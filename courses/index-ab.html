 P1. <br>
Find the equation of the tangent line to the curve: \( e^{2y} x + \frac{3}{\pi} \arcsin(x) = 1 \) at \( x=\frac{1}{2}\). <br>
If you don't remember what \( \arcsin(1/2) \) or \( \ln 1 \) are equal to, you need to review or relearn precalculus concepts. <br>
Find the y-value: \( e^{2y} = 1 \rightarrow y=0 \). <br>
Implicitly differentiate with respect to x: <br>
\( \frac{d(LS)}{dx} = \frac{d(RS)}{dx} \rightarrow e^{2y} + x \left(e^{2y}\right) 2\frac{dy}{dx} + \frac{3}{\pi} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} = 0 \). <br>
Plug in the x- and y-values directly into the result above, to find: \( \frac{dy}{dx}|_{(x=\frac{1}{2}, y=0)} = \frac{-2\sqrt{3}-\pi}{\pi} \) <br>
Set up the point-slope formula, then simplify to: \( y =\left( \frac{-2\sqrt{3}-\pi}{\pi}\right)x +\frac{\sqrt{3}}{\pi} +\frac{1}{2}\)

 <br><br>

 P2. <br>
 To approximate \(\sqrt[5]{33}\), we first define the function \( f(x) = \sqrt[5]{x} \) and an x-value where <br>
 the tangent line will be drawn. In class we called this the "nice" number. In this case, \( a=32 \). <br>
 \( L(x) = f(a) + f'(a) (x-a) = f(32) + f'(32)(x-32) \) <br>
 Compute: \( f(32) = 2, f'(32) = \frac{1}{80} \) before calculating \( f(33) \approx L(33) = 2 + \frac{1}{80} =\frac{161}{80} \). <br><br>

\( y = \frac{x^3 \sqrt[3]{x^2+7}}{(3-x)^6} \rightarrow \ln y = 3 \ln x +\frac{1}{3} \ln(x^2+7) - 6\ln(3-x) \) <br>

Differentiate implicitly before plugging in to find slope. <br>

\( \frac{1}{y} \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{3}{x} +\frac{2x}{3(x^2+7)} -6 \frac{-1}{3-x} \) <br>

Also, note that when \( x=1\), from the original equation, \( y = \frac{1}{32} \) <br>

Plug in the x- and y-values immediately after differentiating (it does not say find the derivative as a rule). <br>
Slope is: \( \frac{73}{384} \). The tangent line equation is: \( y - \frac{1}{32} = \frac{73}{384} (x+1) \). <br><br>

P2.<br>
Note: I replace \( f^{-1}(x) \) with \(g(x)\) below. <br>

\( f(x) = \frac{1}{3} (x^5+2x^3) \rightarrow f'(x) = \frac{5}{3} x^4 +2x^2 \) <br>

Note that by inspection, \( f^{-1}(-1) = -1 \) because \(f(-1) = -1 \). <br>
Therefore \( g'(-1) = \frac{1}{f'(g(-1))} = \frac{1}{f'(-1)} = \frac{1}{11/3} = \frac{3}{11}\).

 Problem 1 went well overall. No drawing was expected or possible here. <br>
 Conclusion: The current is changing at a rate of \( \frac{3}{4} \) amperes per second<br>
 when V is 12 volts and R is 4 ohms. <br><br>

 P2. <br>
 Note that 'eastbound' means going east.  <br>
  After making a drawing, let \( x \) be the distance from the car to the intersection, and let \( z \) <br>
  be the distance from the observer to the car. <br>
  The equation is: \( z^2 = 50^2 + x^2 \). We know that after 5 seconds, \(x = 225\) meters. <br>
  To find the value of \(z \), plug the value of \(x\) into the equation: \( z = \sqrt{50^2 + 225^2} = 25\sqrt{85}\) meters. <br>
  
  We also know that \( dx/dt = 45 m/s \). Fully differentiate with respect to time: <br>
  
  \( 2 z \frac{dz}{dt} = 2 x \frac{dx}{dt} \), to find: \( \frac{dz}{dt} = \frac{225 * 45}{25* \sqrt{85}} = \frac{405}{\sqrt{85}}\) meters per second.

Draw a big cone with an inner cone. The ratio of similar triangles is: \( \frac{r}{h} = \frac{5}{8}\). <br>
The full volume is \( V =\frac{200\pi}{3} \), which means half of it is \( \frac{100\pi}{3} \).
The volume formula is: \( V = \frac{\pi}{3} r^2 h = \frac{25 \pi}{192} h^3 \). <br>
Set this equal to the half volume to find \( h = 4 \sqrt[3]{4} \). <br>
Note that \( h = 4 \) does not give you half the volume because this is a cone and not a cylinder. <br>
After fully differentiating, find \( \frac{dh}{dt} = \frac{3 \sqrt[3]{4}}{125\pi} \) feet per hour. <br>

 Make a neat drawing. <br>
 Let \( x \) be the distance from the telescope to the point on the ground closest to the drone, <br>
 and let \( \theta \) be the angle of elevation. The side opposite \( \theta \) is 1 km .<br>
 The equation is \( \tan\theta = \frac{1}{x} \) or \( \cot\theta = x \) <br>
 Differentiate with respect to time, to get: <br>
 \( -\csc^2\theta \frac{d\theta}{dt} = \frac{dx}{dt} \) <br>
 Plug in the details to find: \( \frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{2}{9\pi} \) km/min. <br>
 Be sure to include a full sentence as your conclusion: At the time when the angle of<br>
 elevation is \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) radian, the drone is traveling at a rate of \( \frac{2}{9\pi} \) km/min.<br><br>
 P2. <br>
 This is similar to the example we did in class on day 2 of related rates<br>
Make a neat drawing.  <br>
Let \( x \) be the distance from the point where the beam hits the shore to the point on the <br>
shore closest to the lighthouse, and let the angle that the beam forms with the closest path <br>
from the lighthouse to the shore (1000 m) be \( \theta \). <br>
The equation is: \( \tan\theta = \frac{x}{1000} \) <br>
Differentiate with respect to time: \( \sec^2 \theta \frac{d\theta}{dt} = \frac{1}{1000} \frac{dx}{dt} \).<br>
Next, plug in: \( \frac{d\theta}{dt} = 4 \pi \) and \( \sec^2(\theta^*) = \frac{17}{16} \).<br>
Note that from precalculus you can easily compute secant from tangent: \( \sec^2 \theta = \tan^2 \theta + 1 = \left[\frac{250}{1000}\right]^2 + 1 = \frac{17}{16} \).<br> 
\( \frac{dx}{dt} = 4250 \pi\) meters per minute. Be sure to include a full sentence as your conclusion. <br><br>

Note that when taking the derivative with respect to x, we needed the product rule (and chain rule) on both sides. <br><br>

b) Plug in \( x= 1 \) into the curve's equation to find two solutions: \( y = -2, y=3 \)<br>
Evaluate each slope at the points (1, -2) and (1,3) by plugging the values into your answer in part a). <br>
Set up the point-slope form of the tangent lines to find the equations: \(y=2x-4 \text{ and } y=3\) <br><br>

c) In order to have a vertical tangent, the denominator of your answer in part a) should be zero, <br>
which yields: \( y = \frac{x^2}{2} \). Plug this into the curve's equation and solve for x. Find \( x = \sqrt[5]{-24}\).<br>

Be sure to draw a neat cylinder with the inner cylinder of 'water'. <br>
The radius radius \( r = 3 \) does not change, so you do not need a variable. <br>
The height \( h \) should be labeled in the drawing. <br>
The big equation is: \( V = \pi 3^2 h \text{ or } V = 9 \pi h \) <br>
Take the derivative with respect to time: <br>
\( \frac{dV}{dt} = 9\pi \frac{dh}{dt} \) <br>
Plug in \( \frac{dV}{dt} = 5 \) to find \( \frac{dh}{dt} = \frac{5}{9\pi} \frac{m}{min} \). <br>

 P1. (Quiz 3) <br>
\( x^2 y^2 + xy = 2 \) <br>
If you prefer, you can rewrite the equation: <br>
\( (xy)^2 + xy = 2 \) <br>
Differentiate implicitly with respect to \( x\) : <br>
\( 2 (xy) [x \frac{dy}{dx}  + y] + [x \frac{dy}{dx}  + y] = 0  \), then plug in \( dy/dx = -1\) <br>
The resulting equation can be factored completely: \( (y-x)(2xy+1) = 0 \) <br>
Case 1: \( y = x\) <br>
Case 2: \( 2xy = -1 \) <br>
Plug in each case into the original equation of the curve.<br>
For case 1, find (-1,-1) and (1,1). For case 2, find that it is impossible.

 a) \( \tan t = \frac{\sin t}{\cos t} \) approaches \( -\infty \) as \( t\to \pi/2^+ \) because sine goes to 1 and cosine goes to zero from  the left side. <br>

  b) Separate variables: \( \int y \text{ } dy = \int (1-x) dx \), then integrate: <br>
  \( \frac{y^2}{2} = x -\frac{x^2}{2} + C \). <br> Plug in (1,1) to find \( C = 0\). <br>
  The general solution is: \( y =\pm \sqrt{2x-x^2} \) but since (1,1) is the initial condition and \( y = 1 > 0 \),<br><br>
  we conclude that the specific solution is: \( y = \sqrt{2x-x^2} \). <br><br>

  P2. <br>
  \( \frac{dT}{dt} = k(T-75); T(0) = 350; T(5) = 340\) <br>
  Separate variables and integrate both sides to find the general solution: <br>
  \(\ln|T-75| =kt+C \). <br>
   \( T-75 = \pm e^{kt+C}\) (Note: the plus option makes sense here. Why?) <br>
   \( T(t) = 75 + e^C e^{kt} \) <br>

 <br> To find the constants \(k\) and \( C \), plug in the two points listed above. <br>
  \( C = \ln 275 \approxeq 5.61677109767 \approxeq 5.617 \). <br>
  \( k  = \frac{\ln(265/275)}{5} \approxeq -0.00740825433607 \approxeq -.007\) <br> 
  To determine the time it takes for the calzone to reach 300 degrees, set \(T=300 \) and solve. <br>
  Using graphing on the TI-84, set \( y_1 = 300, y_2 = 75 + 275 e^{-0.007408254 x} \) (note the use of x rather than t) <br>
  The solution is \( t \approxeq 27.087  \) minutes. <br> Below find the desmos version with details: <br>

  After separating variables, set up the integrals as follows: <br>
\( \int \frac{1}{1+y^2} dy = \int (1+x) dx \) <br>
\( \arctan y = x + \frac{x^2}{2} + C \) <br>
The general solution is \( y = \tan(x+\frac{x^2}{2}+C) \).

  <br><br>
  P2. <br>
  a) \( y = y_0 e^{kt}; y(5) = 0.7 y_0 \) (since 30% is gone) <br>
  \( 0.7 y_0 = y_0 e^{5k} \rightarrow k =\frac{\ln(0.7)}{5} \approxeq -0.071 \) <br>
  \( t_H = \frac{\ln(1/2)}{k}= \frac{-\ln 2}{k} \approxeq 9.763 \) years. (Does this make sense in the context of this problem?) <br> <br>

  b) The percentage remaining is: \( 100 \times \frac{y(t)}{y_0} = 100\times  \frac{y_0 e^{kt}}{y_0} = 100 \times e^{-.071 t} \% \) of the original.

Since we are revolving about the y-axis, the Shell Method is a reasonable choice here. The Washer Method would need to be broken into two integrals and one of them is especially difficult to solve. <br>

  \( f(x) = \arctan(-4x) -\ln(2x)\) at \(x=\frac{1}{4} \)<br>
  \( f(1/4) = \ln 2 - \frac{\pi}{4} \) <br> 
  \( f'(x) = \frac{-4}{1+16x^2} -\frac{1}{x}\) <br>
  The slope of the tangent line is therefore: \( f'(1/4) = -6\) <br>
  The tangent line equation is: \( y = -6x + \frac{3}{2} +\ln 2 -\frac{\pi}{4}\) <br>
  The normal line equation is: \( y = \frac{x}{6} - \frac{1}{24} +\ln 2 -\frac{\pi}{4}\) <br> <br>
  P1. <br>
  The point (1,2) is on the graph of \( g(x) \) because the tangent line touches there. <br>
  Since the slope of the tangent line is 3, that means \( g'(1)= 3\) <br>
  The point (2,1) is on the graph of \( g^{-1}(x) \). <br>
  So we have: \( (g^{-1})'(2) = \frac{1}{g'(g^{-1}(2))} = \frac{1}{g'(1)} = \frac{1}{3} \) <br> 
  The tangent line on \( g^{-1}\) is then: \( y- 1 = \frac{1}{3} (x-2) \) or \( y =\frac{x+1}{3}\). <br><br>

  \( y = \frac{x^3 \sqrt[3]{x^2+7}}{(3-x)^6} \) <br>
  When \( x= 1 \), find \( y=\frac{1}{32} \). <br>
  In order to find the slope of the tangent line, we first take the natural log of both sides: <br>
  \( \ln y = 3 \ln x -\frac{1}{3} \ln(x^2+7) - 6\ln(3-x) \) <br>
  Then we differentiate implictly (i.e. logarithmic differentiation):<br>
  \( \frac{1}{y} \frac{dy}{dx} = \left( \frac{3}{x} +\frac{1}{3} \frac{2x}{x^2+7} - 6 \frac{-1}{3-x} \right) \) <br>
  Plug in \( x=1, y=\frac{1}{32} \) to find \( m = \frac{73}{384}\) <br>
  The equation of the tangent line is: \( y -\frac{1}{32} = \frac{73}{384}(x-1) \) or \( y = \frac{73x-63}{384}\) <br><br>

  By definition, \( (f^{-1}(a))' = \frac{1}{f'(f^{-1}(a))}\). <br>
  When \( a=-1 \), the statement above becomes: \( (f^{-1}(-1))' = \frac{1}{f'(f^{-1}(-1))}\) <br>

  Use precalculus to find \( f^{-1}(-1) \) by setting \(y=1 \) in the original function: \( -1 = \frac{1}{3} (x^5+2x^3) \) <br>
  Rewrite as \( -3 = x^5+ 2x^3 \) and by trial and error confirm that \( x = -1 \), which means \( f^{-1}(-1)= -1\) (A coincidence? Maybe.) <br>

  \( (f^{-1}(-1))' = \frac{1}{f'(-1)} =\frac{1}{\frac{1}{3}(5(-1)^4+6*(-1)^2)} = \frac{3}{5+6} = \frac{3}{11}\)

\( 6 + x^3y = xy^2 \) <br>

a) Differentiate with respect to \(x \). Be sure to use Leibniz notation, as follows. (Do not use \( y'\)!) <br>

\( 0 + 3x^2 y +x^3 \frac{dy}{dx} = y^2 + 2xy \frac{dy}{dx}\) <br>

Find \( \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{3x^2y-y^2}{2xy-x^3} \) or \( \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{y^2-3x^2y}{x^3-2xy} \) <br> <br>

b) When \( x = 1 \), the equation of the curve becomes \( 6+y = y^2 \) <br>

Solve the quadratic equation to find two solutions: \(y=3, y=-2\), so the points are \( (1,3) \) and \( (1,-2)\). <br>

At \( (1,3)\), the slope is zero, so the tangent line has equation \( y =3 \). <br>
At \( (1,-2)\), the slope is 2, so the tangent line has equation \( y=2x-4\). <br> <br>

c) The slope must be undefined when the tangent line is vertical, so be sure to set the derivative's denominator equal to zero: <br>
\( 2xy - x^3 = 0 \) <br>
\( x (2y-x^2) = 0 \) <br>
Case 1: \( x = 0\). Plugging this into the original equation gives us 6 = 0, which is an impossibility.<br>
Case 2: \( y = \frac{x^2}{2} \). Plugging this into the original equation gives us \( x =\sqrt[5]{-24}\), which is the equation of the vertical tangent line. <br>

The question did NOT (!) ask to use the <b> definition of the derivative as a function: </b> \( \lim\limits_{h\to 0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} \).  <br>
The slope comes out to \( \frac{3}{8} \) and the equation of the tangent line is \( y= \frac{3}{8}x + \frac{7}{8} \).

  Set \( f(x) = \cos\sqrt{x} - e^x + 2. \) Note that this function is a sum or difference of continuous functions in their respective domains. <br>
  Therefore \( f(x) \) is continuous on the interval [0, 2]. We can apply the Intermediate Value Theorem. (Be sure the mention it by name!). <br>
  \( f(0) = 1 - 1 + 2 = 2 > 0 \) <br>
  \( f(2) \text{ is some negative number because } -e^2 \) is closer to -9. <br>
  Therefore, by IVT, the function has at least one zero in the open interval (0, 2), which is the same as saying the equation has at least one solution in the interval (0,2). <br><br>

  P2. <br>
  a) \( \lim\limits_{x\to\infty} \frac{\sin^2x}{x^2+1} = 0  \) because the numerator ranges from 0 to 1 and the numerator goes to positive infinity. The ratio therefore goes to zero.<br>
  Note 1: do not break this into a quotient of limits. We can only do that when the individual limits exist. In this case, the limit of the numerator is not some finite value. i.e. it does not exist! <br>
  An alternate approach here is to use the Squeeze Theorem. Start with the double inequality: \( 0 \leq \sin^2 x\leq 1 \), then multiply by \( \frac{1}{x^2+1} \). <br> <bR>


  b) <br>
\( \lim\limits_{x\to 0} x^2 \cos\left(\frac{1}{x^2}\right) = 0 \) <br>
Be sure to use the Squeeze Theorem here. Mention it by name and show the work. The example is almost identical to what we did in class. <br>

  c) <br>
  \( \lim\limits_{x\to (\pi/2)^+} e^{\sec x} = 0  \) because the secant expression goes towards negative infinity as cosine tends towards 0 from the left side. <br>
  Overall, the limit goes to zero.  If you are still struggling with trigonometric expressions, that's a strong hint that you need to review/relearn the precalculus chapters. We will be seeing A LOT OF trigonometry in this class.

  After factoring completely, start with the domain of the function: \( f(x) = \frac{(x-8)(x+2)}{(x-8)(x+1)\sqrt{(x-2)(x+2)}} \).<br>
  The domain of the function is \( (-\infty, -2) \cup (2, 8) \cup (8, \infty) \), so we should(!) ignore \( x  = -1 \). <br><br>
  The function has an infinite discontinuity (vertical asymptote) at \( x = 2 \) and a removable discontinuity at \( x = 8 \). (FULL CREDIT if you got this far.) <br>
  The function approaches 0 as x goes to -2 from the left. As an exercise, you can confirm this by setting up the one-sided limit. The graph has a hole at \( (-2, 0) \), but because the function is not defined on both sides, this point is neither a jump nor a removable discontinuity. <br>




  A desmos plot of the graph of the function is below: <br>

  Optionally, after checking that the limit form is \( \frac{0}{0} \) (use arrows!), multiply both top and bottom by the conjugate of the numerator: \( (1+\cos\theta) \), and then simplify using the fundamental trig identity and the fact that \( \lim\limits_{\theta \to 0} \frac{\sin \theta}{\theta} = 1 \) <br>

 c) <br>
 Check that the form is 0 over 0 (using arrows), then manipulate the limit as follows: <br>
 \( \lim\limits_{x\to 0}\frac{3x - \sin(kx)}{x} =\lim\limits_{x\to 0}\frac{3x}{x} - \lim\limits_{x\to 0}\frac{\sin(kx)}{x} = 3 - k \lim\limits_{x\to 0}\frac{\sin(kx)}{kx} = 3 - k*1 = 3 - k  \).

Do not use equal signs between the limit sign and the expression. <br> <br>

Specific issues: <br>
The only problem that presented a challenge of sorts was \( \lim\limits_{x\to1} \frac{x^3-1}{x^2-1} \) <br>
After checking that both numerator and denominator go to zero, use the difference of squares for the bottom and the difference of cubes formula for the top.<br>
\( A^3 - B^3 = (A-B)(A^2 + AB + B^2) \) <br>
\( \lim\limits_{x\to1} \frac{x^3-1}{x^2-1} = \lim\limits_{x\to1} \frac{(x-1)(x^2+x+1)}{(x-1)(x+1)} =  \lim\limits_{x\to1} \frac{x^2+x+1}{x+1} = \frac{3}{2} \)

The slope field for \( \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1-x}{y} \) was okay, except along the horizontal axis (y=0) be sure to draw vertical line to indicate that the slope is undefined there. <br>
The typical solution should pass through the initial point (1,1). After separating variables:<br>
\( \int y dy = \int (1-x) dx  \) <br>
\( \frac{y^2}{2} = x - \frac{x^2}{2} + C\) (do not forget the integration constant). <br>
Plug in (1,1) to find C=0, then solve for y: <br>
\( y^2 = 2x-x^2  \) <br>
\( y = \pm \sqrt{2x-x^2} \). Conclude that the because the point (1,1) is part of the solution, we pick the positive root option: <br>

Separate variables: <br>
\( \int \frac{1}{T-75} dT = \int k dt \) <br>
Integrate both sides and add the integration constant: <br>
\( \ln |T-75| = kt + C \)  (Note the required use of the absolute value.)<br>
Plug in \( t=0, T = 350 \) to find \( C = \ln 275 \approxeq 5.61677 \) <br>
Plug in \( t=5, T = 340 \) to find \( k = \frac{\ln 265 - \ln 275}{5} \approxeq -0.0074 \) <br> <br>

The problem did not ask for the general solution, but if you must state the solution, be sure to write: <br>
\( |T-75| = e^C e^{kt} \) <br>
\( T - 75 = \pm e^C e^{kt}\) <br> 
\( T(t) = 75 \pm e^C e^{kt} \) <br> 
And then choose the positive option because the temperatures we are looking at are clearly more than 75 degrees.<br> <br>

To find the time it takes for the temperature to "cool" to 300 degrees, plug in T = 300: <br>

\( \ln 225 = kt + \ln 275 \rightarrow t^{*} = \frac{\ln 225 - \ln 275}{k} \approxeq 27.087 \text{minutes} \).

P2. <br>
Make a diagram of the two ships (see above) <Br>
x = distance traveled by ship A.<br>
y = distance traveled by ship B. <br>
z = distance between the ships. <br>
Equation: \( z^2 = (x+y)^2 + 100^2 \) <br>

Differentiate both sides with respect to time, then plug in: <br>

\( dx/dt=35, dy/dt=25, x=140, y=100 \) to find the unknown rate. As we mentioned twice right before writing the quiz, be sure to write a conclusion.

\( y= 3x - \tan x \). The given line has equation: \( y=x+2 \), so the slope is 1. <br>
\( dy/dx = 3 - \sec^2 x \rightarrow dy/dx=1  \) <br>
\( \sec^2 x = 2 \rightarrow \sec x = \pm \sqrt{2} \)  <br>
\( x = \pi/4 \pm k \pi/2 \) <br>
Since it is asking for all x-values, be sure to cover all the quadrants. <br>

\( f(x)= 6x \cot x, x=\pi/6 \) <br>
\( f(\pi/6)= \sqrt{3}\pi \) <br>
\( f'(x) = 6 \cot x - 6x \csc^2x \)  <br>
\( f'(\pi/6)= 6\sqrt{3} - 4\pi \)
\( \text{normal line's slope =} \frac{1}{4\pi - 6\sqrt{3}} \)

The normal line equation is: \( y -  \sqrt{3}\pi =\frac{1}{4\pi - 6\sqrt{3}} (x-\pi/6) \) <br> 
A somewhat simplified version of this would be okay, too.

a) \( f'(x)= \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} = \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{3/(1-(x+h))-3/(1-x)}{h} =\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{3}{h} ( \frac{1}{1-x-h}-\frac{1}{1-x}) \) <br>

  \( f'(x) = \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{3}{h} ( \frac{(1-x)-(1-x-h)}{(1-x-h)(1-x)} ) = \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{3}{h} ( \frac{h}{(1-x-h)(1-x)} ) = ...= \frac{3}{(1-x)^2}   \) <br>

a) \( \lim_{x\to \infty} \frac{\sin^2 x}{x^2+1} = 0 \) with reasoning: <br>
    The numerator fluctuates between 0 and 1 since the range of the sine function is [-1, 1]. Dividing such a quantity by something that goes to infinity gives zero. <br><br>
	
b) \( \lim_{x\to 0} x^2 \cos(1/x^2) = 0 \) using the Squeeze Theorem. To show work here, confirm that the individual limits are 0 and DNE, and then start with the double inequality: <br>
 \( -1 \leq \cos(1/x^2) \leq 1 \) This is not different from the examples we did in class.<br>
c) \( \lim_{x\to \pi/2^+ } e^{\sec x} = 0 \) with reasoning: the secant function goes to negative infinity because cosine goes to 0 from the negative side. Raising e to an amount that goes to negative infinity gives zero. <br>
d) Rewrite as: \( \lim_{x\to \infty} \frac{\cos x}{e^{2x}} = 0 \) with reasoning: the numerator is bounded between -1 and 1, whereas the denominator goes to infinity. Therefore the quotient goes to zero. <br>
e) \( \lim_{x\to 0^+} \tan^{-1}\ln x = \frac{-\pi}{2} \) with reasoning: the natural log goes to negative infinity; the arctangent function goes to its horizontal asymptote on the left: \(\ -\pi/2 \) <br> <br>
