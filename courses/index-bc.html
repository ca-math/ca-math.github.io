P1. <br>
The area of the semi-circle is given by the integral of the equation of the upper-half of the circle. <br>
Feel free to use symmetry to rewrite as: <br>
\( A = \int_{-m}^m \sqrt{m^2-x^2} dx = 2 \int_0^m \sqrt{m^2-x^2} dx \) <br>
Draw a triangle for the trigonometric substitution: \( x = m \sin\theta \) and update the bounds: <br>
\( x = 0 \rightarrow \theta = 0 \) <br>
\( x = m \rightarrow \theta = \pi/2 \) <br>
You'll need to use the cosine double angle formula in order to evaluate the definite integral. 

<br><br>
P2. <br>
From Algebra 2, \( A^3 + B^3 = (A+B) (A^2 - AB + B^2) \) We reviewed this at the start of the school year. <br>
The factored form makes it easy to break \( \frac{1}{x^3+8} \) into partial fractions:<br>
\( \frac{1}{(x+2)(x^2-2x+4)} = \frac{A}{x+2} + \frac{Bx+C}{x^2-2x+4}\) <br>
Find: \( A = \frac{1}{12}, B = \frac{-1}{12}, C=\frac{1}{3} \), and then integrate. <br><br>

P1. <br>
\( A = \int_3^5 \frac{x^3}{\sqrt{x^2-4}} dx \)  <br>
Draw a right triangle with one acute angle \(\theta \), the adjacent side 2, and hypotenuse \(x\). <br>
\( x = 2\sec\theta \rightarrow dx = 2 \sec\theta \tan\theta d\theta \) <br>
The bounds of integration are: <br>
\( x = 3 \rightarrow \theta = \arccos(2/3) \text{ or } \tan\theta = \sqrt{5}/2\) <br>
\( x = 5 \rightarrow \theta = \arccos(2/5) \text{ or } \tan\theta = \sqrt{21}/2\) <br>
The final answer for area is: \( \frac{33\sqrt{21}-17\sqrt{5}}{3}\) <br>
<br>
P2. <br>
\( y_{avg} = \frac{1}{1-0} \int_0^1 f(x) dx = \int_0^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{9-4x^2}} dx  \) <br>
Proceed with trig substitution: \( x = \frac{3\sin\theta}{2} \rightarrow dx = \frac{3}{2} \cos(\theta) d\theta \) <br>
Be sure to update the bounds: <br>
 \( x=0 \rightarrow \theta = 0  \) <br>
  \( x=1 \rightarrow \theta = \arcsin(2/3) = m  \) <br>
The integral becomes: \( \int_0^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{9-4x^2}} dx = \int_0^m \frac{1}{3 \cos\theta} \frac{3}{2} \cos(\theta) d\theta \) <br>
The final answer is: \( \frac{1}{2} \arcsin(2/3) \)

We know that \( f''(x) = 6x\). From the fact that the tangent line equation is: \( y = 5 - 3x \) at \(x=1 \), <br>
we also know that \( f(1) = 2, f'(1) = -3 \)<br>
Integrate: \( f'(x) = \int f''(x) dx = \int 6x dx  = 3x^2 + C_1 \) <Br>
Plug in \( x=1, f'(1) = -3 \), to find \( C_1 = -6 \)<br>
Integrate again: \( f(x) = \int f'(x) dx = \int (3x^2 -6) dx = x^3 -6x + C_2 \)<br>
Plug in \(x=1, f(1) = 2 \), to find \( C_2 = 7 \) <br>
Therefore, \( f(x) = x^3 - 6x + 7\).

  P1. <br>
 \( f(x) = \frac{1}{x} \) is not continuous on the interval \( [-1, 1] \) because it has a vertical asymptote <br>
 at \( x = 0 \). Therefore, the Mean Value Theorem cannot be applied. The statement is false. <br>

 <br>

 P2. <br>
 "If a function has three x-intercepts, then there must be at least two points on the graph<br>
 of the function where the tangent line is horizontal. " This statement is false because <br>
 we do not know if the function is continuous and differentiable on the interval between the smallest <br>
and largest x-intercept. You can draw an example here. The statement would be true if the function is both continuous and differentiable <br>
because we can apply Rolle's Theorem twice. <Br>
<br>
P3. <br>
\( f(x) = \tan x \) is continuous on the interval \( [0, \pi/4] \) and differentiable on the open interval<br>
\( (0, \pi/4) \), therefore MVT can be applied here. <br>
\( f'(c) = \sec^2(c) = \frac{f(\pi/4)-f(0)}{\pi/4 - 0} \rightarrow \sec^2(c) = \frac{4}{\pi} \) <br>
\( \sec(c) = \pm \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \rightarrow \cos c = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2} \) <br>
\( c = \arccos\left(\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}\right)\) <br>
Note that we ignore the negative root above because it is not in the interior of our given interval.<br><br>

  Use L'Hospital's Rule after checking conditions and taking the natural log both sides. <br>

The function \( f(x) = x^3 e^{-2x}\) is a product of two continuous functions on the entire domain of real numbers, therefore it is continuous on the interval [1, 4]. <br>
We use the Closed Interval Method here. (Be sure to state the name of the method and the reason why the function is continuous.) <br>

Of the two critical numbers, only 3/2 is in the given domain. Evaluate \( f(3/2) = \frac{27}{8e^3}, f(4) = \frac{64}{e^8}, f(1) = \frac{1}{e^2} \)

The definition of slope as a number is either: <br>
 \( m = \lim\limits_{h \to 0}\frac{f(-3+h)-f(-3)}{h} \) <br>
 OR <br>
 \( m = \lim\limits_{x \to -3}\frac{f(x)-f(-3)}{x-(-3)} \) <br>
Choose one and see where it takes you. Below I show work with the second definition: <br>

\( m = \lim\limits_{x \to -3}\frac{f(x)-f(-3)}{x-(-3)} = \lim\limits_{x \to -3}\left(\frac{12}{3-x}-\frac{12}{3-(-3)}\right) \frac{1}{x+3} = \) <br>
\( = 12 \lim\limits_{x \to -3}\left(\frac{1}{3-x}-\frac{1}{6}\right) \frac{1}{x+3} = 12 \lim\limits_{x \to -3}\left(\frac{6-(3-x)}{6(3-x)}\frac{1}{x+3}\right) = \) <br>
 \( = 12 \lim\limits_{x \to -3}\left(\frac{3+x}{6(3-x)}\frac{1}{x+3}\right) = 12\lim\limits_{x \to -3}\left(\frac{1}{6(3-x)}\right) = \frac{12}{36} = \frac{1}{3}    \) <br> <br>
 Since \( f(-3) = \frac{12}{3-(-3)} = 2 \), we use the point-slope formula to find the equation of the tangent line: <br>

 \( y - 2 = \frac{1}{3} (x-(-3)) \), which simplifies to \( y = \frac{1}{3} x + 3\)

 \( \lim\limits_{x\to \pi^-} 2^{\cot h} = \lim\limits_{x\to \pi^-} 2^{\frac{\cos h}{\sin h}} \)<br>

 Use arrows or explain how cosine goes to -1 and sine goes to 0 from positive side, so the cotangent expression goes to negative infinity. <br>
 The overall limit is therefore 0, since \( 2^{-\infty} = \frac{1}{2^{\infty}} \to 0 \)  <br><br>

\( \lim\limits_{\theta \to 0} \sec\left( \frac{1-\cos(2\theta)}{\theta} \right) = \sec \left( \lim\limits_{\theta \to 0} \frac{1-\cos 2\theta}{\theta} \right) = \\
\sec \left(2 \lim\limits_{\theta \to 0} \frac{1-\cos 2\theta}{2 \theta} \right) \)

\( \lim\limits_{t \to 0^+} \left( \ln(\tan t) -\ln(\sin 2t) \right) = \lim\limits_{t \to 0^+} \ln \left[ \frac{\tan t}{\sin 2t} \right] = \\
=\ln \lim\limits_{t \to 0^+}  \left[ \frac{\sin t}{2 \cos^2 t \sin t}  \right] = \ln(1/2) = -\ln 2 \)

P2.<br>
Let the left side of the equation be the function \( f(x) = x + \sin x - 1 \). Note that since all three terms are continuous for all real numbers, the sum is also continuous everywhere. <br>
Therefore, \( f(x) \) is continuous on the interval \( [0, \frac{\pi}{6}] \), which means we can apply the Intermediate Value Theorem.<br>
Note that \( f(0) = -1 \) and \( f(\pi/6) =\frac{\pi}{6} + \frac{1}{2} - 1 \approxeq 0.52 - 0.5 > 0\).
Since the function changes sign and is continuous on the given interval, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, it must have at least one zero on the given interval. <br>
This is the same as saying: the equation \( f(x) = 0 \) has at least one solution on the interval \([0, \frac{\pi}{6}]  \).

  \( \lim\limits_{x\to-4^+} g(x) =\lim\limits_{x\to-4^+} \frac{(x+1)(x+4)}{|x+4|} = \lim\limits_{x\to-4^+} \frac{(x+1)(x+4)}{x+4} = \lim\limits_{x\to-4^+} (x+1) = -3 \) <br>
  \( \lim\limits_{x\to-4^-} g(x) =\lim\limits_{x\to-4^-} \frac{(x+1)(x+4)}{|x+4|} = \lim\limits_{x\to-4^-} \frac{(x+1)(x+4)}{-(x+4)} = \lim\limits_{x\to-4^-} -(x+1) = 3 \) <br>
  The overall limit does not exist since the one-sided limits are different. <br>
  The graph of the function consists of two linear pieces: <br>
  \( g(x) = x+1 \) for \( x > -4 \). <br>
 \( g(x) = -x-1 \) for \( x < -4 \). <br>

The statement is false.  As an example, consider: \( f(x) =\frac{|x|}{x}, g(x) = \frac{-|x|}{x} \) <br>
The individual limits of these two functions as \(x\) approaches zero do not exist. The limit of the product is -1, however.

  The sketching problem went well on average. Some of the papers had the curves that were not functions (they failed the vertical line test) <br>
  Also, remember to draw neatly and <i>approach</i> the asymptote without crossing it. It's okay to cross the horizontal asymptote as long as you make sure the graph <i> returns </i> towards it. <br><br>

  P2. <br>
 The sketch of the piece-wise function is shown below with desmos. The limit exists for all real values except \( a = 0 \). <br>
 The one sided limits as \( x \) approaches zero are 1 and -1, which means \( \lim\limits_{x\to 0} f(x) \) does not exist. <br><br>

Q1.<br>
a. 2.778<br>
b. 1.282 <br>
c. The limit is 0.<br>
d. Absolute maximum @ t = 11.442. The maximum is 7.317.<br>
<br>
Q2.<br>
a. 1.031<br>
b. 2.067<br>
c. x(0.95532) = 0.770 (Use CIM to justify.)<br>
d. 15.465<br>
<br>

Q3. <br>
a. 5 words per minute per minute<br><br>

b. Yes, by IVT, R (c) = 155  at least once on [8, 10] since 155 is between R (8) = 150  and R (10) = 162. The function R is continuous because it is given as differentiable.<br><br>

c. 1252<br>
d. 1300<br>
<br>
Q4.<br>
a. g'(x) = f(x) by FTC, so g'(8) = f(8) = 1 <br>
b. g''(x)  = f'(x), which changes sign at x = -3, 3, 6.<br>
    These are the inflection points on the graph of g.<br><br>
c. g(12) = 9<br>
   g(0) = -9pi/2<br>
d. Consider critical numbers and endpoints:
    g(-6) = g(6) = 0<br>
    g(0) = -9pi/2<br>
    g(12) = 9<br>
   By the Closed Interval Method, the global minimum occurs at x=0.<br><br>

Q5. <br>
a. f''(1) = -9<br>
b. T(x) = -1 + 2 (x - 1) - (9/2) (x - 1)^2<br>
c. LEB = | 60 * 0.1^3/(3!)| = 1/100. The error cannot exceed the bound.<br>
d. f(1.4) is approximately equal to -0.470.<br><br>

Q6.<br>
a. [1, 7) with work and reasoning<br>
b.  f' (x) = (1/3) (x - 4) + (1/3^2) (x - 4)^2 + (1/3^3) (x - 4)^3 + ... + (1/3^n)  (x - 4)^n + ...<br><br>

c.<br>
a = r = (x-4)/3, so the series converges to a/(1 - r)  = (x - 4) / (3 - x + 4) = (x - 4) /(7 - x)<br>
<br>
d.<br>
x=8 is not in the interval of convergence of the original function f(x), so f'(x) will not converge at x=8 either.

Be sure to draw a right triangle with all three sides labeled. <br>
\( dx = a \sec\theta \tan\theta d\theta \) <br>
After the substitution of the expressions for \( x \) and \( dx \), the integral reduces to: <br>
\( \int \sec\theta d\theta = \ln |\sec\theta + \tan\theta | + C = \ln\left| \frac{x +\sqrt{x^2-a^2}}{a} \right| + C \)

Option 1: \( u = 4x^2 +9, du = 8 x dx, x^3 = x^2 x  = \frac{u-9}{4} x \) <br>
Remember to switch the bounds of integration to \( 9 \leq u \leq 36 \) when switching from \( dx \) to \( du\).<br>

<br><br>
Option 2: Use trigonometric substitution with \( x = \frac{3}{2} \tan\theta \) <br>
Be sure to draw a right triangle and update the bounds: \( 0 \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{3}\) <br>

The final answer with either approach comes out to 3/32.

We know for all four parts that \( f'(x) = v(x)\). <br>
a) \( \int 2 v(x) dx = 2 \int v(x) dx = 2 f(x) + C \), so statement 1 is true. <br>
b) The derivative of \( f(2x) \) is \( 2 f'(2x) = 2 v(2x) \), so the second statement is false. <br>
   \( f(x) = sin(x), v(x) = \cos(x) \) should work as an example. <br>
c) \( \int (v(x) + 1) dx = f(x) + x + K \), so the third statement is false. <br>
d) If we use the same example as the one in part b), we can see that \( (\sin x)^2 \) is not an anti-derivative of \( (\cos x)^2\). Therefore the fourth statement is false. 
<br><br>
P2. <br>
\( a(t) = -32 \rightarrow \int (-32) dt  = -32t + C = v(t)\)<br>
Since the initial velocity is zero, it follows that \(C = 0 \). <br>
The velocity when the stone hits the ground is -120. The time at which this happens can be determined by solving: <br>
\( v(t) = -32t = -120 \rightarrow t=\frac{15}{4} \). <br>
the position function is: \( s(t) = \int v(t) dt = \int (-32 t) dt = -16t^2 + K  \). <br>
The position is zero when \( t = \frac{15}{4} \), so find \( K = 225\) feet. <br>
The constant is also the height of the cliff since it is the value of the position function \( s(t) = -16t^2 + 225 \) when \( t =0 \) <br><br>

  <i> If there are typos or mistakes, let me know so I can fix them here. </i> <br><br>
 Vocab Quiz: <br>
 a) The Second Derivative Test is used to justify local extrema. Be sure to state that f(x) has a stationary number at x=c, so the first derivative is zero there. List all three cases about the second derivative:
  If the second derivative at x=c is positive, then f(c) is a local minimum. <br>
  If the second derivative at x=c is negative, then f(c) is a local maximum. <br>
  If the second derivative is also zero, then the test is inconclusive. <br><br>
b) EVT states that a function f(x) that is continuous on a closed interval [a, b] is guaranteed to have an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum on that interval.<br><br>
c) x=c is a critical number of a function f(x) if f'(c) is either zero or undefined. <br><br>
d) A function f(x) has an inflection point at x=c if three conditions are met: f is continuous, f'(x) does NOT change sign at x=c, and f''(x) changes sign at x=c. <br><br>
e) The First Derivative Test is used to justify local extrema. Be sure to state the function must be continuous at a critical number x=c. <br>
Case 1: If f' changes sign from + to - at x=c, then f(c) is a local maximum. <br>
Case 2: If f' changes sign from - to + at x=c, then f(c) is a local minimum. <br>
Case 3: If f' does not change sign at x=c, then f(c) is not a local extremum. <br> <br>

The function \( f(x) = x^3 e^{-2x}\) is a product of two continuous functions on the entire domain of real numbers, therefore it is continuous on the interval [1, 4]. <br>
We use the Closed Interval Method here. (Be sure to state the name of the method and the reason why the function is continuous.) <br>
Find the derivative and consider two cases: when/if it equals 0 and when/if it is undefined. <br>

\(  f'(x) = \frac{x^2 (3-2x)}{e^{2x}} \rightarrow x=0, x=3/2\) <br>

Of the two critical numbers, only 3/2 is in the given domain. Evaluate \( f(3/2) = \frac{27}{8e^3}, f(4) = \frac{64}{e^8}, f(1) = \frac{1}{e^2} \)
to find that the absolute maximum is \( \frac{27}{8e^3} \) and the absolute minimum is \( \frac{64}{e^8} \).

  Therefore, since the the sign changes from negative to positive and the graph of f(x) is continuous on the given interval, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, the function has at least one x-intercept in the given interval, which is the same as saying that the equation has at least one root on the given interval.

  Be sure to remember the chain rule when finding the derivative. <br> 

  Factor before separating variables: <br>
  \( \int e^{-y} dy = \int (x+2) dx \) <br>

  \( -e^{-y} = \frac{x^2}{2} + 2x + C \leftarrow (0, 0) \) <br>
 \( C = -1  \), therefore: \( -e^{-y} = \frac{x^2}{2} + 2x - 1 \) <br>
 Multiply both sides by -1, to get: <br>
 \( e^{-y} = 1- 2x - \frac{x^2}{2} \) <br>
 Take the natural log: <br>
 \( -y = \ln | 1 - 2x - \frac{x^2}{2}| \) <br>
 Multiply by (-1) <br>
 
 \( y = = - \ln | 1 - 2x - \frac{x^2}{2}| \) <br>
 Optionally, you can also write the solution as: <br>
 \( y = \ln |\frac{1}{1-2x-\frac{x^2}{2}}| =\ln |\frac{2}{2-4x-x^2}| \)

  Be sure to remember the chain rule when finding the derivative. <br> 

  \( f(x) = (\frac{x}{2})^4 + \frac{1}{2x^2} \rightarrow f'(x) = \frac{x^3}{4}-\frac{1}{x^3} \) <br>

  \( (dy/dx)^2 + 1 = \frac{x^6}{16} - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{x^6} + 1 = \frac{x^6}{16} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{x^6} = (\frac{x^3}{4}+\frac{1}{x^3})^2  \) <br>
  <br>

  \( L = \int_1^4 \sqrt{(dy/dx)^2 + 1} dx =  \int_1^4 \frac{x^3}{4}+\frac{1}{x^3} dx = ... = \frac{525}{32} \)

 a) \( \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n (n+1)3^n}{ 2^{2n+1}} \) <br>
 The Ratio Test works best here. Be sure to use the absolute value notation: <br>

 \( |\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}| = |\frac{(n+2)3^{n+1}}{2^{2n+3}} * \frac{2^{2n+1}}{(n+1)3^n}| = ... |\frac{n+2}{n+1} \frac{3}{4}|\rightarrow \frac{3}{4} < 1 \) <br>
 Since the series converges absolutely, it convergs. <br> <br>

 b) \( \sum_{n=1} (-1)^n \frac{\sqrt{n}}{2n+1} \) <br>
 Use the alternating series test  here. We need to check and show work for two conditions: <br>
 First, \( b_n = \frac{\sqrt{n}}{2n+1} = \frac{1/\sqrt{n}}{2+\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}} \rightarrow \frac{0}{2+0} = 0 \) <br>
 Second, confirm that \( b_{n+1} \leq b_n\). You can do this algebraically or by taking the derivative of \( f(x) = \frac{\sqrt{x}}{2x+1}\) and confirming that the derivative is negative. <br>

 c) \( \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\cos 3n}{1+(1.2)^n} \) <br>
 This is similar to the example from class. We show absolute convergence for the given series by using the comparison test twice: <br>
 \( | \frac{\cos 3n}{1+(1.2)^n} | \leq \frac{1}{1+(1.2)^n} < \frac{1}{(1.2)^n} = (5/6)^n \) <br>
 The right-most sequence above makes a geometric series that is convergent, so by the Comparison Test, the original series converges absolutely, and therefore it converges. <br>

 d) \( \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-5)^{2n}}{n^2 9^n} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{5^{2n}}{n^2 9^n}  \) <br>
 Use the ratio test with care to show that the series diverges. Note that: \( a_{n+1} = \frac{5^{2(n+1)}}{(n+1)^2 9^{n+1} }\). The ratio ends up approaching 25/9, which is greater than 1. <br>

  <b> April 4, 2024 | Thoughts on problem 15 from today's worksheet.</b> <br>
 
  An odd number can be described as \( 2n-1 \) or \( 2n+1 \) if n is a positive integer. <br> 
   In the absence of a formula for the product of the odd numbers, we write: <br>
   \( \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1*3*...*(2n-1)}{n!} \) <br>
   Proceed to test using the Ratio Test:
   \( |\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}| = | \frac{1*3*...*(2n-1)(2n+1)}{(n+1)*n!} \frac{n!}{1*3*...*(2n-1)}| = |\frac{2n+1}{n+1}|\rightarrow 2 > 1  \) <br>
   Therefore the series diverges.

  <hr>

  a) True. All sequences are functions because for every n in the domain there is exactly one term of the sequence. <br>
  b) False. Consider \( a_n=(-1)^n, b_n = (-1)^{n+1} \). The sequence \( \{a_n + b_n\} \) converges to 0 even though the individual sequences diverge. <br>
  c) False. Consider \( \{(-1)^n \}_{n=1}^{\infty} \). <br>
  d) True. The y-value of the horizontal asymptote is also where the sequences converges. <br> <br>

  P2.<br>
  a) This is geometric sequence with \( r=\frac{\pi}{4} \). Since \( -1 < r  \leq 1 \), the sequence converges. In this case it converges to 0. <br>
  b) The positive part of the sequence converges to 2. Therefore the sequences oscillates between approximately 2 and approximately -2. The sequence therefore diverges. <br>
  c) The natural log goes to infinity. The outer function (arctangent) goes towards \( \pi/2 \), therefore the sequence converges to \( \pi/2 \). <br>

The distance function of the boat going south is: \( x(t) = 20t \). <br>
The distance function of the boat going east towards the same dock is \( y(t) = 15-15t \), because at the beginning (t=0) this boat is located 15 km away and its velocity is negative since it is approaching the dock. <br>
Set up the square of the distance as the objective function: \( Q(t) = (x(t))^2 + (y(t))^2 = 225 (1-t)^2 + 400t^2 \) <br>
The domain is \( 0 \leq t \leq 1 \).
Find the derivative: \( Q'(t) = 450(t-1) + 800 t = 1250 t -450 \) <br>
The only critical number is: \(  t= \frac{9}{25}\) <br>
Evaluate: \( Q(0)= 225, Q(1) = 400, Q(9/25) = 144 \) <br>
By the Closed Interval Method, the minimum of the square of the distance occurs at the critical number; the correspoding time is 2:21:36 (21 minutes and 36 seconds past 2:00 PM).
At this time the distance will be a minimum as well.

  In your drawing label the dimensions of the print area as x (width) and y (height). <br>
  \( xy = 42 \rightarrow y = 42/x \) <br>
  \( Q(x) = (x+3)(y+2) = (x+3)(42/x + 2) = 42 + 2x + 126/x + 6 \) with domain \( x > 0 \) <br>
  \( Q'(x) = 2-\frac{126}{x^2} = \frac{2(x^2-63)}{x^2} \) <br>
  List three critical numbers and identify only \( x = \sqrt{63} = 3\sqrt{7} \) as part of the domain. <br>
  The other dimension of the print area is: \( y = 2\sqrt{7} \) <br>
  The dimension of the paper with least area are: \( 3\sqrt{7} + 3  \) by \( 2\sqrt{7} + 2 \) <br>
To justify, use the First Derivative Test for Global Extrema. Note that the numerator of the factored version of the derivative is a quadratic expression. Its graph is a parabola that opens up and changes from negative to positive at the critical number. This implies that the original function has a global minimum at \(x = 3\sqrt{7} \). <br> 
The Second Derivative Test for Global Extrema works as well. No matter which test you use, be sure to explain! <br>

  P1. <br>
  Note that the term extrema is the plural of extremum. Since the problem asks about the global extrema, we need to check for both max and min. <br>
  First, we state that the function is continuous on the given interval, which means we can use the Closed Interval Method: <br>
  Find and factor the first derivative completely: \(f'(x)=x^2 e^{-2x} (3-2x) \) <br>
  Find two critical numbers: 0, 3/2. Only 3/2 is in the given interval from 1 to 4, so we ignore 0. <br>
  Evaluate the function at the endpoints and at the critical number: <br>
  \( f(1)=\frac{1}{e^2} \\ f(3/2) =\frac{27}{8e^3} \\ f(4)=\frac{64}{e^8} \) <br>
  
  Compare these three values by rewriting each fraction with a common denominator: <br>
  \( f(1)=\frac{8e^6}{8e^8} \\ f(3/2) =\frac{27 e^5}{8e^8} \\ f(4) = \frac{8*64}{8e^8} \) <br>
  Absolute maximum: \( (\frac{3}{2}, \frac{27}{8e^3}) \) <br>
  Absolute minimum: \( (4, \frac{64}{e^8}) \) <br><br>

  Draw a circle with radius r. Set up the area equation: \( A(t) =\pi (r(t))^2 \) <br>
  Differentiate with respect to time: \( dA/dt = 2 \pi r \frac{dr}{dt} \) <br>
  Plug in to find find: \( \frac{dA}{dt} = 100.8\pi \frac{ft^2}{min} \) <br>
  Conclusion: When the radius of the oil slick is 120 ft, its area is increasing at a rate of \( 100.8\pi ft^2/min\). <br><br>
  
  P2. <br>
  Make a drawing of a straight shoreline and a point R (radar) 6 km away from the nearest point B on the shore. <br>
  Label a point down the shore as point A, and call AB = x. The angle ARB is \( \theta \). The moment we are interested in is when the angle BAR is 45 degrees, which means the angle ARB is also 45 degrees.<br>
  We know that \( \frac{d\theta}{dt} = \frac{2\pi}{5} rad/s \) <br />
  With this set up, the equation is: \( \tan\theta = \frac{x}{6} \) or if you prefer, \( \theta = \arctan(x/6) \) <br><br>

  Differentiate both sides with respect to time, to find \( dx/dt = \frac{24\pi}{5} \frac{km}{s} \) <br>
  Conclusion: When the beam makes a 45 degree angle with the shore, the radar beam is moving at a rate of \( \frac{24\pi}{5} \frac{km}{s}\). <br><br>
