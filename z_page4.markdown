Comprehensive Final Exam: 20% (in AP subjects we will not write a spring final exam) <br>

# learning tools

textbook (issued on first day) <br>
notebook or note-taking devices with all notifications turned off<br>
writing utensils <br>
laptop with working wireless connection <br>
ap study guide <br>
graphing calculator (see approved models below)

# attendance

If you must be absent and you know ahead of time, then let me know and I will try to refer you to the topic to be covered that day. You are responsible for obtaining missed notes and other class details from your classmates. Given the pace of the curriculum, I must inform you that one missed class meeting can have a big impact on your progress in this course.

# smart devices

All smart phones/watches should be stored in the school bag and on mute/vibrate. I will announce ahead of time when we plan to use smart devices for learning purposes.

# spoken language

We are expected to speak English in the classroom space.

# calculators

TI-83/84/89/NSPIRE are recommended graphing calculator models. The in-class demonstrations will focus on the TI-84 features. Be sure to check the calculator policy on the college board website at <a href="https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/exam-policies-guidelines/calculator-policies" target="_blank">this link</a>. In addition to the graphing calculator, we will also use a few CAS applications, so be sure to bring your laptop to class daily.
