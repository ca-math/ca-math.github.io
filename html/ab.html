 <font color="red"> <b> A note regarding myCushing grades:</b> The fall semester ends in February. The gradebook setup from the start of the year is making it difficult for the current grade to appear next to your name under progress. So, for now, please use the weekly updates to get your grade. (The 'fall_grade' label was placed there to help inform you. There are few other classes that do not have this.) Let me know if you have any questions.   </font> <br>

-offers neat graph illustrating the details from previous steps <br>
-Note 1: for these types of problems we will add more steps during week 15. <br> 
-Note 2: be sure to designate a factor and not the term of a sum or difference to each row in the sign table. <br>
-Note 3: correct answers with no work shown are never a good idea. <br>
-Note 4: when stating points, be sure to include the y-value. <br> <br>

P1 Comments: <br>
-state domain <br>
-f'(x) = (x + sin(x) cos(x)) / ( (cos x)^2) <br>
-f''(x) = 2 (1+ tan x) / ((cos x)^2) <br>
-the critical number for f(x) is x=0. Argue that there is no other by thinking about the expression x + sin(x) cos(x) and whether this can equal zero for another x-value on the given domain. <br>
-the sign table needs justifications (for example, consider quadrant 1, and then do the same for quadrant 4). <br>
-there are no critical numbers for f'(x) but we still need to set up a simple table summarizing the sign of the second derivative (always positive) with an explanation. <br> 
-summarize ID Behavior / concavity / extrema / and inflection points.  <br> <br>

P2 Comments: <br>
-state domain <br>
-f'(x) = (x^(2/3) - 1 ) / (x^(2/3)) <br>
-f''(x) = 2 / (3 x^(5/3))<br>
-critical numbers of f(x): -1, 0, 1 <br>
-critical numbers of f'(x):  0 <br> 
-summarize ID Behavior / concavity / extrema / and inflection points.  <br> <br>

P3 Comments: <br>
-state domain <br>
-f'(x) = (e^x) (e^(2x)-1) <br>
-f''(x) =(e^x) (e^(4x)-1)<br>
-critical numbers of f(x): -ln 2  <br>
-critical numbers of f'(x): -ln 4 <br> 
-summarize ID Behavior / concavity / extrema / and inflection points.  <br> <br>

P4 Comments: <br>
-state domain, identify vertical asymptote and horizontal asymptote <br>
-f'(x) = (3x^2)/(x^3 +1)^2<br>
-f''(x) =(-6x)(2x^3 - 1) / (x^3+1)^3<br>
-critical numbers of f(x): -1, 0 <br>
-critical numbers of f'(x): -1, 0, cuberoot(1/2) <br> 
-summarize ID Behavior / concavity / extrema / and inflection points.  <br> <br>

P5 Comments: <br>
-state domain: all reals except (-2, 1) <br>
-f'(x) = (2x+1)/(2 sqrt(x^2+x-2)) <br>
-f''(x) = -9 / (4 (x^2+x-2)^(3/2)) <br>
-critical numbers of f(x): -2, 1  (find but ignore x=-1/2 since it is outside the domain)<br>
-critical numbers of f'(x): -2, 1 <br> 
-leave the "middle" region of the table blank, for x on (-2, 1), since that it is not part of the domain <br>
-neither derivative is defined at the endpoints, so write the question mark symbol. <br> 
-summarize ID Behavior / concavity / extrema / and inflection points.  <br> <br>

P6: (4 points) <br>
-finds f'(x) and factors it completely. <Br>
-finds all critical numbers: c1 = 0, c2 = 1, c3 = a/(a+b). Note that c1 and c2 are the endpoints. <br>
-computes f(c3) = [a^a b^b] / [](a+b)^(a+b)] <br>
-concludes that f(c3) is the absolute and local maximum and justifies using the closed interval method (evaluate end points and state continuity) OR using the first derivative test by explaining why the factors change their sign the way they do. Once again, it is important that we explain the signs and not just fill out a chart fast. <Br> <br>
	
P7: (4 points) <br>
-finds dF/dtheta = mu W (mu cos(theta) - sin(theta))/(mu sin(theta) + cos(theta))^2 (note: you have seen this problem before in a different context) <br>
-finds theta = arctan(mu) as the only critical number <br>
-justifies using the first derivative test with convincing details that the sign of the derivative changes from positive to negative at the critical point. <br>
-concludes that a local and global maximum is achieved at the critical number, using the first derivative test. <br>
-concludes that no local or global minimum is achieved due to the domain restriction.<br>
-Note: do not plug in end points here as they are not stated as part of the domain.<Br><br>

<i> The raw score or percentage for this assignment will be included in the weekly report. </i> <br> <br>
P1: (5 points) <br>
a) True with reasoning/explanation. Find dy/dx directly.<br>
b) False with reasoning/explanation. Consider the equation of a circle: x^2 + y^2 = 25.<br>
c) False with reasoning/explanation. (Common Chain Rule mistake.) <br>
d) False with reasoning/explanation. This is incorrect because instead of f'(x) we need f'(u).<br>
e) False with reasoning/explanation. (Another Chain Rule mistake).<br><br>

P2: (7 points)<br>
-finds dF/dtheta either using the quotient rule (plus Chain Rule) or by moving the denominator to the numerator and then using the power rule with the chain rule. <br>
-dF/dtheta = (mu W (sin(theta) - mu cos(theta))) / (cos(theta) + mu sin(theta))^2 <br>
-Evaluates to -9(3sqrt(3)-10)/(sqrt(3)+0.3)^2 lb/radian when theta = pi/6. (include units) <br>
-For part b) writes out the Chain Rule: dF/dt = dF/dtheta * dtheta/dt, converts dtheta/dt into: -pi/360 before multiplying it by the answer to part a) <br>
-Finds dF/dt = (pi (3sqrt(3)-10)) / (40 (sqrt(3)+0.3)^2) lb per second (include units) <br>
<br>
-Note 1: Do not use a calculator. The instructions are clear.<br>
-Note 2: Leave sqrt(3) as such. Do not give approximations unless the problem asks us to.<br>
-Note 3: The rate translates to -0.5 degrees/second because of the word 'decreasing'.<br>
-Note 4: Get in the habit of always converting from degrees to radians whenever you do calculus.<br><br>



P3: (3 points) <br>
-finds the derivative dW/dt = 200(t-5) (Now that we have covered the chain rule, please don't distribute the given form.) <br>
-evaluates dW/dt = -2000 gal/min at t= 5. Write this step separately from the first step, like we have done in class. <br>
-sets up and evaluates the average rate of change as (W(5) -W(0)) / (5 - 0) = -2500 gal/min <br>
-Please don't state the rates as positive if you include sentences, unless you use words like 'decreasing' or 'draining', etc. <br> <br>

P4: (5 points) <br>
-finds dy/dx implicitly: dy/dx = (2x-1)/(4y^3+2y). (If you did not complete the work for the async meeting on Friday, do it now.)<br>
-states that for the tangent line to be vertical we need the denominator to be 0 (while the numerator is nonzero) <br>
-finds y = 0 <br>
-plugs into the original equation to find two points (0, 0) and (1,0) <br>
-Note: Do not just state the x-coordinates <br> <br>

P5: (5 points) <br>
-finds dy/dx = (4x)/(3y^2) implicitly (again, if you did not complete the work from the async meeting on Friday, do it now.) <br>
-states that the slope must equal 2 because the given line has slope (-1/2) <br>
-when solving the equation in terms of y, identify both solutions y=0 and y=2/9 and exclude y=0 since the slope is undefined in this case <br>
-find the x-coordinate and conclude (2/27, 2/9) <br><br>

P6:(5 points)<br>
-states that g'(x) = -f'(pi/2 - x) <br>
-investigates by taking the derivatives of both sides of each of the following: cos(x) = sin(pi/2 - x), cot(x) = tan(pi/2 - x) and csc(x) = sec(pi/2 - x) <br> 
-concludes, in grammatically correct English, that the derivatives of the given functions are in fact the opposites of the co-functions. <br>

<b> Notes on Assignment and Assessment from Week 7</b> <br />
<u>Assignment Notes (25 points maximum) </u> <br>

P1: 6 points <br>
a) Continuous at x=1 with confirmation that the overall limit exists and is equal to the y-value; Not differentiable at x=1 with two one-sided limits that are not equal to each other. <br>
b) Continuous at x=1 with confirmation that the overall limit exists and is equal to the y-value; Differentiable at x=1 with two one-sided limits that are equal to each other. Therfore f'(1) exists. <br> <br>


P2: 4 points <br>
Note that we were expecting the simplest possible forms for f(x) here. Some students gave f(x) options that do work but are more complex looking than they need to be. <br>
a) f(x) = x^7;  a=1 <br>
b) f(x) =cos(x); a=pi <br>
c) f(x) = x^2; x=3  (for some reason some of you wrote f(x) = x1^2 here) <br>
d) f(x) = sqrt(x);  a=1 <br> <br>

P3: 4 points <br>
a) gallons per dollar per gallon or simply: gallons^2 per dollar. <br>
b) Since it asks for the meaning in practical terms, we can't comment on this by saying "the instantaneous rate of change is ..."; instead, we say that dg/dp is the approximate change in the amount of gallons sold when the price goes up by a dollar per gallon. <br>

c) The sign is negative because we typically expect less to be sold at a higher price. <br>

d) Approximately (!) 100 fewer gallons will be sold when the price goes up from 10 dollars per gallon to 11 dollars per gallon. <br><br>

P4: 5 points <br>
General criteria for this writing task: <br>
-content and accuracy: be sure to explain what differentiability means formally by referring to both algebra (the limit of the difference quotient exists) and geometry (a unique finite slope of the tangent line at a point exists), and informally: the graph is smooth at a point. <br>
-correct grammar <br>
-at least two paragraphs <br>
-detailed examples <br><br>

P5: 6 points<br>
Note 1: If you did not use limits but the answers were correct, you earned at most two points out of six in this question.<br>
Note 2: Drawing the graphs for this question will help you better understand it. <br><br>
a)  Let the point(s) on the graph of the function be (a, f(a)). Find the derivative function using limits: f'(a)=-2 a. Set up slope in two different ways, as rise over run from (a, f(a)) to (1, 12), and as the value of the derivative function at x = a. Solve for a, to get a = -1 or a=3. The two lines have equations y=-6x + 18 and y=2x+10.  <br>

b)  Let the point(s) on the graph of the function be (a, f(a)). Find the derivative function using limits: f'(a)=-1/(a-1)^2. Setting this equal to -1 and solving for a, we get: a=0 or a=2. The two lines have equations y=-x -1 and y= -x+3.  <br>

P1 (6 points) <br>
a) Set up f'(1) using the limit definition (x->1 or h->0) and show that the two one-sided limits are different. Therefore f'(1) does not exist and the statement is false. <br>

b) Set up the function in piecewise format (like in algebra 2 with the curly brace). For each branch find the derivative using the limit definition. At x=0 and x=1 conclude that the f'(x) does not exist by using part a) for f'(1) and explicity checking f'(0). <br>
 f'(x) = 2x - 1 for x < 0  or x > 1. <br>
 f'(x) = 1- 2x for 0 < x < 1  <br> <br>

P2 (2 points) <br>
-f(x) => Graph a.  f'(x) => Graph c.  f''(x) => b. <br>
-Do not explain with concepts you have not learned in this class. <br>
-More specifically, only comment on the relationship between the curves in terms of the slope/steepness of the tangent line (positive, negative, or zero)<br>
-Use coherent English sentences, please. <br> 
-If the graphs have labels, please use the labels instead of saying the pink graph or the green graph etc. <br>
-Please note that a curve and a line describe two different things. Please do not use one term for the other. <br> <br>



P3 (4 points) <br>
-Find the derivative as a function OR find the derivative as a number twice. In both cases, you need to use limits.<br>
-If you choose option 1, f'(x) = 6/(1-3x2)^2 <br>
-At the point (0, 2) with slope 6, we get y=6x+2 <br>
-At the point (-1, 1/2) with slope 3/8 we get y = (3x)/8 + (7/8). <br><br>

<p>-some of the papers were incredibly hard to read (too dark and the presentation was far from neat, unfortunately)</p>
<p>-to those who are making pdf-s, thank you very much. I appreciate the format.</p>
<p>-please be careful and use limits</p>
<p>-explain your work in grammatically correct English sentences</p>
<p>-do not use a calculator (we have been very clear about this in writing and during class)</p>
<p>-do not use knowledge or techniques that we have not taught. I am ONLY interested in assessing what you are learning in this class.</p>
<p>-if I have specific feedback that I need to share with you, I will either email you directly or write my comment in the weekly grade report on Monday night.</p>
<p><u>Grading Rubric</u></p>
<p><u>Problem 1: 4 points maximum</u></p>
<p>Each part is worth 1 point (0 for incorrect; half credit for missing or incorrect explanation)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>a) True with explanation (properties of limits or visual example)</p>
<p>b) False with example</p>
<p>c) False with example</p>
<p>d) True with explanation (For limits of rational functions we can directly substitute if x approach a point in their domain)</p>
<p><u>Problem 2: 5 points maximum</u></p>
<p>a) 1 point</p>
<p>a=2 with explanation (In order for the limit to exist, we must have 0/0 so that the factors can cancel out)</p>
<p>b) 1 point</p>
<p>1/(x^2) shoot off to positive infinity faster than 1/x goes to negative infinity.</p>
<p>c) 1 point</p>
<p>Solve algebraically to confirm that the top goes to 1 and the bottom goes to 0 from the positive side.</p>
<p>Please get in the habit of using arrows instead of plugging in numbers like 0.000001.</p>
<p>d) 2 points</p>
<p>There are several cases to consider here. If p(x) also goes to zero, then there is a hole, so the limit will exist. If p(a) is non-zero, a vertical asymptote will occur, and the type will depend on the value of p(a) and how q(x) approaches zero. Drawings were expected here.</p>
<p><u>Problem 3: 5 points maximum</u></p>
<p>a) 3-k with work shown (use limit notation carefully)</p>
<p>b) 0 with work shown (use limit notation carefully)</p>
<p>c) 2 with work shown (use limit notation carefully)</p>
<p>d) 0 with work shown (use limit notation carefully)</p>

<p><u>Problem 4: 2 points maximum</u></p>
<p>a) positive infinity (with explanation / work)</p>
<p>b) -5 with work shown (use limit notation carefully)</p>
<p><u>Problem 5: 4 points maximum</u></p>
<p>a) Make a conjecture, in plain English, with reason why you think so. The two quantities approach each other as the the angle approaches zero, so we claim that the limit is 1. (2 points)</p>
<p>b) Set up function for both the arc and the chord, and then evaluate the one sided limit to be equal to 1. The arclength formula is r theta; for the chord, use the the isosceles triangle to find the length of the chord in terms of r and theta. Use the limit to confirm the conjecture. Show and justify your work carefully. (2 points)</p>

<b> Week 2 Assignment Notes</b> <br />
<p>*** Feel free to use the notes/key below to go over your work. Please email me when you find mistakes in any answer key I share with you. Thank you. ***</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 1</p>
<p>I am calling g(x) the inverse function below.</p>
<p>a) g(x) = cuberoot((x+1)/8) or g(x)=cuberoot(x+1) / 2.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>b) The inverse function does not exist because the original function does not pass the horizontal line test. If we restrict the domain to only include half the parabola, we can find an inverse.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>c) g(x) = ln(sqrt(x-1))</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>d) g(x) = (x+2)/(x-1)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>e) g(x) = 1 / (arcsin(x)+2)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>f) g(x) = tan((1-x)/(3x))</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 2</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;E = 10^(16.7) joules (include units)</p>
<p>b) The magnitude will be 2/3 Richter scale units greater.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 3</p>
<p>The function will pass the horizontal line test as long ax+b and cx+d do not have the same zero. (-b/a cannot equal -d/c.) If they have the same zero, the graph will not have a vertical asymptote and will instead look line with a skip (hole).</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The inverse function is given by g(x) = (b-xd)/(cx-a).</p>
<p>As always, show work leading to your answer.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 4</p>
<p>We can&#39;t include graphs on this page, but you can confirm your work with the TI-84, by choosing Math, Num, Option 5 for int(), which represents the greatest integer function.</p>
<p>For example, for part b, plot Y1 = int(x^2)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>(Note that this was a no-calculator assignment.)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 5</p>
<p>In this problem we need to consider the domain of the inner function.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>a) [0, pi] with reasoning</p>
<p>b) [-1, 1] with reasoning</p>
<p>c) (-pi/2, pi/2) with reasoning</p>
<p>d) (-infinity, infinity) with reasoning</p>

<p>c) neither with explanation</p>
<p>d) even with explanation</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>Showing the transformations step by step is the best way to approach this.</p>
<p>The final version of the transformed function is g(x) = -2 |x+1| + 3</p>
<p>Be sure to graph the original function and the the new one on the same window.</p>
<p>(Transformations are summarized in Chapter P and in one of our recent lessons.)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>3.&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) g(x) = cuberoot(x+1)/2</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>b) No inverse exists here because the original function fails the horizontal line test.</p>
<p>&nbsp; We could find the inverse but only if we restrict the domain (and you had to say so).</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>4.</p>
<p>y = a x^2 + b x + c</p>
<p>With a = 3/10, b=0, and c = -6/5</p>
<p>Important: please use reduced fractions (2/3 and not 4/6) and if possible avoid decimal numbers. Rounding in this class is done at the end of the problem and it is to be done in 3 decimal places. For example, write 0.667 for 2/3, but we prefer 2/3.</p>
