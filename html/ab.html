<b> Week 2 Assignment Notes</b> <br />
<p>*** Feel free to use the notes/key below to go over your work. Please email me when you find mistakes in any answer key I share with you. Thank you. ***</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 1</p>
<p>I am calling g(x) the inverse function below.</p>
<p>a) g(x) = cuberoot((x+1)/8) or g(x)=cuberoot(x+1) / 2.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>b) The inverse function does not exist because the original function does not pass the horizontal line test. If we restrict the domain to only include half the parabola, we can find an inverse.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>c) g(x) = ln(sqrt(x-1))</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>d) g(x) = (x+2)/(x-1)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>e) g(x) = 1 / (arcsin(x)+2)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>f) g(x) = tan((1-x)/(3x))</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 2</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;E = 10^(16.7) joules (include units)</p>
<p>b) The magnitude will be 2/3 Richter scale units greater.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 3</p>
<p>The function will pass the horizontal line test as long ax+b and cx+d do not have the same zero. (-b/a cannot equal -d/c.) If they have the same zero, the graph will not have a vertical asymptote and will instead look line with a skip (hole).</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The inverse function is given by g(x) = (b-xd)/(cx-a).</p>
<p>As always, show work leading to your answer.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 4</p>
<p>We can&#39;t include graphs on this page, but you can confirm your work with the TI-84, by choosing Math, Num, Option 5 for int(), which represents the greatest integer function.</p>
<p>For example, for part b, plot Y1 = int(x^2)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>(Note that this was a no-calculator assignment.)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 5</p>
<p>In this problem we need to consider the domain of the inner function.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>a) [0, pi] with reasoning</p>
<p>b) [-1, 1] with reasoning</p>
<p>c) (-pi/2, pi/2) with reasoning</p>
<p>d) (-infinity, infinity) with reasoning</p>

<b> Meeting #009 | September 4, 2020</b> <br />
-Expect more review/practice today. Materials (Meeting009.zip) are now live. <br />
-On Thursday evening I accidentally posted an assignment that said 'Read Chapter 1' for this course. We are still on Chapter P and Chapter 1 has not been uploaded. That was a mistake on my part. <br>
-In the Downloads section I have added two resources: a Precalculus textbook (use it to review) and scanning instructions for Android and iOS. <br>
<br>

-Find today's instructions and related materials in Meeting007.zip <br />
 
 -Please note: Now that we have moved to one assignment per week, the daily Meeting folder (zip archive) won't need to go live at midnight, but it will be posted on myCushing before the scheduled class meeting, assuming there are materials to go with the meeting for that day.<br> <br>
 
 Also, for live class meetings please remember to always have the following:<br>
 <br>
 -zoom video on <br>
 -zoom audio on mute <br>
 -phone on mute/vibrate<br>
 -writing tools<br>
 -paper unless you are using an iPad to write<br>
 -graphing calculator<br> <br>

<p>Notes / Answer Key Only&nbsp;</p>
<p>*** Please email me when you find mistakes in any answer key I share with you. Thank you. ***</p>
<p>*** Also, please remember that your work for this class should never look like an answer key. We need to show work for full credit. ***</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>1.</p>
<p>a) odd with explanation</p>
<p>b) even with explanation</p>
<p>c) neither with explanation</p>
<p>d) even with explanation</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>Showing the transformations step by step is the best way to approach this.</p>
<p>The final version of the transformed function is g(x) = -2 |x+1| + 3</p>
<p>Be sure to graph the original function and the the new one on the same window.</p>
<p>(Transformations are summarized in Chapter P and in one of our recent lessons.)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>3.&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) g(x) = cuberoot(x+1)/2</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>b) No inverse exists here because the original function fails the horizontal line test.</p>
<p>&nbsp; We could find the inverse but only if we restrict the domain (and you had to say so).</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>4.</p>
<p>y = a x^2 + b x + c</p>
<p>With a = 3/10, b=0, and c = -6/5</p>
<p>Important: please use reduced fractions (2/3 and not 4/6) and if possible avoid decimal numbers. Rounding in this class is done at the end of the problem and it is to be done in 3 decimal places. For example, write 0.667 for 2/3, but we prefer 2/3.</p>

<p>1.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;f + g = (2x^2 + 1) / ((x^3) + x ) &nbsp;Domain: x is nonzero</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;f - g = -1 / ((x^3) &nbsp;+ x) &nbsp; &nbsp; Domain: x is nonzero</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;fg = 1/((x^2) +1) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Domain: x is nonzero (we use the original form with x in the bottom)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;f/g = (x^2) / ((x^2) + 1) &nbsp; Domain: x is nonzero (we use the original form with x in the bottom)</p>

<p>f(g(x)) = sqrt(sqrt(x^2 +3)-3) &nbsp; domain: (-infinity, -sqrt(6)) u (sqrt(6), infinity)</p>
<p>g(f(x)) = sqrt(x) &nbsp;domain: x is greater than or equal to 3 &nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: the inner function won&#39;t be defined for x less than 3, so we can&#39;t say x is greater than or equal to zero.</p>

<p>b) none / impossible</p>
<p>c) for x greater than or equal to 25</p>
