<b> Meeting #007 | September 2, 2020</b> <br />
-Find today's instructions and related materials in Meeting007.zip <br />
 -Please note: Now that we have moved to one assignment per week, the daily Meeting folder (zip archive) won't need to go live at midnight, but it will be posted on myCushing before the scheduled class meeting, assuming there are materials to go with the meeting for that day.<br>

<p>Notes / Answer Key Only&nbsp;</p>
<p>*** Please email me when you find mistakes in any answer key I share with you. Thank you. ***</p>
<p>*** Also, please remember that your work for this class should never look like an answer key. We need to show work for full credit. ***</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>1.</p>
<p>a) odd with explanation</p>
<p>b) even with explanation</p>
<p>c) neither with explanation</p>
<p>d) even with explanation</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>Showing the transformations step by step is the best way to approach this.</p>
<p>The final version of the transformed function is g(x) = -2 |x+1| + 3</p>
<p>Be sure to graph the original function and the the new one on the same window.</p>
<p>(Transformations are summarized in Chapter P and in one of our recent lessons.)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>3.&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) g(x) = cuberoot(x+1)/2</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>b) No inverse exists here because the original function fails the horizontal line test.</p>
<p>&nbsp; We could find the inverse but only if we restrict the domain (and you had to say so).</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>4.</p>
<p>y = a x^2 + b x + c</p>
<p>With a = 3/10, b=0, and c = -6/5</p>
<p>Important: please use reduced fractions (2/3 and not 4/6) and if possible avoid decimal numbers. Rounding in this class is done at the end of the problem and it is to be done in 3 decimal places. For example, write 0.667 for 2/3, but we prefer 2/3.</p>

<b> Meeting #004 | August 27, 2020</b> <br />
-Find today's instructions in Meeting004.zip (live at 12:01AM) <br />
-Lesson recording will be posted after the meeting in the playlist above. <br>
-Friendly reminder: please upload homework by 11:59pm. Once again, it will be just 4 problems. <br> <br>
<p>Notes / Answer Key Only&nbsp;</p>
<p>*** Please email me when you find mistakes. Thank you. ***</p>
<p>*** Also, please remember that your work for this class should never look like an answer key. ***</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>1.</p>
<p>a) g(x) = (x+6)/7</p>
<p>b) g(x) = (x+1) / (x-1)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>a) Show by finding the inverse explicitly.</p>
<p>b) The graph of the original function has a symmetry about y=x.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>3.&nbsp;</p>
<p>x = 8/5</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>4.</p>
<p>y = (-x/3) + 1</p>
<p>y = (-x/12) - (1/2)</p>

<b> Meeting #003 | August 26, 2020</b> <br />
-Find today's instructions in Meeting003.zip (live at 12:01AM) <br />
-A very brief lesson recording will be posted after the meeting in the playlist above. <br> <br>
<p>Notes / Answer Key Only&nbsp;</p>
<p>*** Please email me when you find mistakes. Thank you. ***</p>
<p>*** Also, please remember that your work for this class should never look like an answer key. ***</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>1.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;f + g = (2x^2 + 1) / ((x^3) + x ) &nbsp;Domain: x is nonzero</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;f - g = -1 / ((x^3) &nbsp;+ x) &nbsp; &nbsp; Domain: x is nonzero</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;fg = 1/((x^2) +1) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Domain: x is nonzero (we use the original form with x in the bottom)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;f/g = (x^2) / ((x^2) + 1) &nbsp; Domain: x is nonzero (we use the original form with x in the bottom)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>f(g(x)) = sqrt(sqrt(x^2 +3)-3) &nbsp; domain: (-infinity, -sqrt(6)) u (sqrt(6), infinity)</p>
<p>g(f(x)) = sqrt(x) &nbsp;domain: x is greater than or equal to 3 &nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: the inner function won&#39;t be defined for x less than 3, so we can&#39;t say x is greater than or equal to zero.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>3.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>a) 3h + 6x</p>
<p>b) 3w + 3x</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>4.</p>
<p>Note that the answers below need a brief explanation.</p>
<p>a) True.</p>
<p>b) False.</p>
<p>c) True.</p>
<p>d) False.</p>

<b> Meeting #002 | August 25, 2020</b> <br />

-Lesson recording will be posted after the meeting in the playlist above. <br> <br>
<p>Notes / Answer Key Only&nbsp;</p>
<p>*** Please email me when you find mistakes. Thank you. ***</p>

<p>1.</p>
<p>a) -2, 10, 10, 25, 4,, 27t^2-2</p>
<p>b) 0, 4, -4, 6, 2sqrt(2), 1/(3t) or 6t (this depends on the value of t)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>a) 2, 0, (pi+1)/(pi-1), 1/21, (t^2) / ((t^2)-2)</p>
<p>b) 2, 3, sqrt(pi+1), 3, |t| or 3 (depending on the value of t)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>3.</p>
<p>a) Temperature does not change abruptly, so we expect this relationship to be a continuous curve.</p>
<p>b) The number of boxes is an integer, so we expect this relationship to be a broken curve.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>4.</p>
<p>a) x = 9</p>
<p>b) none / impossible</p>
<p>c) for x greater than or equal to 25</p>
<p>d) y has a minimum value of 1. y grows without bound so it does not have a maximum value.</p>
