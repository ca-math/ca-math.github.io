<b> Notes on Assignment and Assessment from Week 7</b> <br />
<u>Assignment Notes (25 points maximum) </u> <br>

P1: 6 points <br>
a) Continuous at x=1 with confirmation that the overall limit exists and is equal to the y-value; Not differentiable at x=1 with two one-sided limits that are not equal to each other. <br>
b) Continuous at x=1 with confirmation that the overall limit exists and is equal to the y-value; Differentiable at x=1 with two one-sided limits that are equal to each other. Therfore f'(1) exists. <br> <br>


P2: 4 points <br>
Note that we were expecting the simplest possible forms for f(x) here. Some students gave f(x) options that do work but are more complex looking than they need to be. <br>
a) f(x) = x^7;  a=1 <br>
b) f(x) =cos(x); a=pi <br>
c) f(x) = x^2; x=3  (for some reason some of you wrote f(x) = x1^2 here) <br>
d) f(x) = sqrt(x);  a=1 <br> <br>

P3: 4 points <br>
a) gallons per dollar per gallon or simply: gallons^2 per dollar. <br>
b) Since it asks for the meaning in practical terms, we can't comment on this by saying "the instantaneous rate of change is ..."; instead, we say that dg/dp is the approximate change in the amount of gallons sold when the price goes up by a dollar per gallon. <br>

c) The sign is negative because we typically expect less to be sold at a higher price. <br>

d) Approximately (!) 100 fewer gallons will be sold when the price goes up from 10 dollars per gallon to 11 dollars per gallon. <br><br>

P4: 5 points <br>
General criteria for this writing task: <br>
-content and accuracy: be sure to explain what differentiability means formally by referring to both algebra (the limit of the difference quotient exists) and geometry (a unique finite slope of the tangent line at a point exists), and informally: the graph is smooth at a point. <br>
-correct grammar <br>
-at least two paragraphs <br>
-detailed examples <br><br>

P5: 6 points<br>
Note 1: If you did not use limits but the answers were correct, you earned at most two points out of six in this question.<br>
Note 2: Drawing the graphs for this question will help you better understand it. <br><br>
a)  Let the point(s) on the graph of the function be (a, f(a)). Find the derivative function using limits: f'(a)=-2 a. Set up slope in two different ways, as rise over run from (a, f(a)) to (1, 12), and as the value of the derivative function at x = a. Solve for a, to get a = -1 or a=3. The two lines have equations y=-6x + 18 and y=2x+10.  <br>

b)  Let the point(s) on the graph of the function be (a, f(a)). Find the derivative function using limits: f'(a)=-1/(a-1)^2. Setting this equal to -1 and solving for a, we get: a=0 or a=2. The two lines have equations y=-x -1 and y= -x+3.  <br>

<u>Assessment Notes (Maximum: 12 points)</u> <br>
<u> Group reminders: </u>
Submit work on time. Learn to scan pictures to create a SINGLE pdf file, please. We should not have to post and send so many reminders. <br><br>

P1 (6 points) <br>
a) Set up f'(1) using the limit definition (x->1 or h->0) and show that the two one-sided limits are different. Therefore f'(1) does not exist and the statement is false. <br>

b) Set up the function in piecewise format (like in algebra 2 with the curly brace). For each branch find the derivative using the limit definition. At x=0 and x=1 conclude that the f'(x) does not exist by using part a) for f'(1) and explicity checking f'(0). <br>
 f'(x) = 2x - 1 for x < 0  or x > 1. <br>
 f'(x) = 1- 2x for 0 < x < 1  <br> <br>

P2 (2 points) <br>
-f(x) => Graph a.  f'(x) => Graph c.  f''(x) => b. <br>
-Do not explain with concepts you have not learned in this class. <br>
-More specifically, only comment on the relationship between the curves in terms of the slope/steepness of the tangent line (positive, negative, or zero)<br>
-Use coherent English sentences, please. <br> 
-If the graphs have labels, please use the labels instead of saying the pink graph or the green graph etc. <br>
-Please note that a curve and a line describe two different things. Please do not use one term for the other. <br> <br>



P3 (4 points) <br>
-Find the derivative as a function OR find the derivative as a number twice. In both cases, you need to use limits.<br>
-If you choose option 1, f'(x) = 6/(1-3x2)^2 <br>
-At the point (0, 2) with slope 6, we get y=6x+2 <br>
-At the point (-1, 1/2) with slope 3/8 we get y = (3x)/8 + (7/8). <br><br>

<b> Notes on Assignment and Assessment from Week 5</b> <br />
<u>Assignment Notes (20 points maximum) </u> <br>
General comments: <br>
Do not use your calculator. <br>
Round to 3 decimal places or leave answers as a reduced fraction. <br>
Include units whenever units are given. <br>

P1: 5 points <br>
a) <br>
sets up the limit for velocity at given time <br>
evaluates limit to -39.200 m/s (with units) <br>
b)<br>
sets s(t)=0 and solves: t= 50/7 s <br>
sets up the limit for velocity at given time <br>
evaluates limit to -70 m/s (with units) <br>

P2: 5 points <br>

4 with work<br>
DNE with explanation<br>
b)<br>
domain: (-infinity, 0] u [1, infinity) with reason<br>
0 with reason <br>
0 with reason <br>

P3: 2 points <br>
a) 2 with work<br>
b) Yes. Setting f(0) = 2 will make the function continuous at x=0. <br>

P4: 5 points <br>
a) 240000/17 dollars (leave it like that, it's fine -- some of you, unfortunately, used your calculators here.) <br>
b) 80000 dollars<br>
c) 720000 dollars <br>
d) set up limit and evaluate to positive infinity. <br>
Meaning: The cost rises without bound as we get closer to 100% removal of air pollutants. <br>

P5: 3 points<br>
compute right sided limit = a <br>
compute left sided limit = a^2 -2 <br>
set the limits equal and solve, to get a=-1 or a=2 <br>
However, since f(0) is undefined, no value of a will make the function continuous at x=0. <br>
Hence no value of a will make the function continuous for all real numbers. <br><br>

<p><strong>Notes to Assignment for Week 4</strong></p>
<p>*** Feel free to use the notes/key below to go over your work. Please email me when you find mistakes in any answer key I share with you. Thank you. ***</p>
<p><u>G</u><u>eneral comments for the group</u></p>
<p>-some of the papers were incredibly hard to read (too dark and the presentation was far from neat, unfortunately)</p>
<p>-to those who are making pdf-s, thank you very much. I appreciate the format.</p>
<p>-please be careful and use limits</p>
<p>-explain your work in grammatically correct English sentences</p>
<p>-do not use a calculator (we have been very clear about this in writing and during class)</p>
<p>-do not use knowledge or techniques that we have not taught. I am ONLY interested in assessing what you are learning in this class.</p>
<p>-if I have specific feedback that I need to share with you, I will either email you directly or write my comment in the weekly grade report on Monday night.</p>
<p><u>Grading Rubric</u></p>
<p><u>Problem 1: 4 points maximum</u></p>
<p>Each part is worth 1 point (0 for incorrect; half credit for missing or incorrect explanation)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>a) True with explanation (properties of limits or visual example)</p>
<p>b) False with example</p>
<p>c) False with example</p>
<p>d) True with explanation (For limits of rational functions we can directly substitute if x approach a point in their domain)</p>
<p><u>Problem 2: 5 points maximum</u></p>
<p>a) 1 point</p>
<p>a=2 with explanation (In order for the limit to exist, we must have 0/0 so that the factors can cancel out)</p>
<p>b) 1 point</p>
<p>1/(x^2) shoot off to positive infinity faster than 1/x goes to negative infinity.</p>
<p>c) 1 point</p>
<p>Solve algebraically to confirm that the top goes to 1 and the bottom goes to 0 from the positive side.</p>
<p>Please get in the habit of using arrows instead of plugging in numbers like 0.000001.</p>
<p>d) 2 points</p>
<p>There are several cases to consider here. If p(x) also goes to zero, then there is a hole, so the limit will exist. If p(a) is non-zero, a vertical asymptote will occur, and the type will depend on the value of p(a) and how q(x) approaches zero. Drawings were expected here.</p>
<p><u>Problem 3: 5 points maximum</u></p>
<p>a) 3-k with work shown (use limit notation carefully)</p>
<p>b) 0 with work shown (use limit notation carefully)</p>
<p>c) 2 with work shown (use limit notation carefully)</p>
<p>d) 0 with work shown (use limit notation carefully)</p>
<p>e) ln(2) with work shown (use limit notation carefully)</p>
<p><u>Problem 4: 2 points maximum</u></p>
<p>a) positive infinity (with explanation / work)</p>
<p>b) -5 with work shown (use limit notation carefully)</p>
<p><u>Problem 5: 4 points maximum</u></p>
<p>a) Make a conjecture, in plain English, with reason why you think so. The two quantities approach each other as the the angle approaches zero, so we claim that the limit is 1. (2 points)</p>
<p>b) Set up function for both the arc and the chord, and then evaluate the one sided limit to be equal to 1. The arclength formula is r theta; for the chord, use the the isosceles triangle to find the length of the chord in terms of r and theta. Use the limit to confirm the conjecture. Show and justify your work carefully. (2 points)</p>

<b> Week 2 Assignment Notes</b> <br />
<p>*** Feel free to use the notes/key below to go over your work. Please email me when you find mistakes in any answer key I share with you. Thank you. ***</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 1</p>
<p>I am calling g(x) the inverse function below.</p>
<p>a) g(x) = cuberoot((x+1)/8) or g(x)=cuberoot(x+1) / 2.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>b) The inverse function does not exist because the original function does not pass the horizontal line test. If we restrict the domain to only include half the parabola, we can find an inverse.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>c) g(x) = ln(sqrt(x-1))</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>d) g(x) = (x+2)/(x-1)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>e) g(x) = 1 / (arcsin(x)+2)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>f) g(x) = tan((1-x)/(3x))</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 2</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;E = 10^(16.7) joules (include units)</p>
<p>b) The magnitude will be 2/3 Richter scale units greater.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 3</p>
<p>The function will pass the horizontal line test as long ax+b and cx+d do not have the same zero. (-b/a cannot equal -d/c.) If they have the same zero, the graph will not have a vertical asymptote and will instead look line with a skip (hole).</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The inverse function is given by g(x) = (b-xd)/(cx-a).</p>
<p>As always, show work leading to your answer.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 4</p>
<p>We can&#39;t include graphs on this page, but you can confirm your work with the TI-84, by choosing Math, Num, Option 5 for int(), which represents the greatest integer function.</p>
<p>For example, for part b, plot Y1 = int(x^2)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>(Note that this was a no-calculator assignment.)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 5</p>
<p>In this problem we need to consider the domain of the inner function.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>a) [0, pi] with reasoning</p>

<p>1.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;f + g = (2x^2 + 1) / ((x^3) + x ) &nbsp;Domain: x is nonzero</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;f - g = -1 / ((x^3) &nbsp;+ x) &nbsp; &nbsp; Domain: x is nonzero</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;fg = 1/((x^2) +1) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Domain: x is nonzero (we use the original form with x in the bottom)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;f/g = (x^2) / ((x^2) + 1) &nbsp; Domain: x is nonzero (we use the original form with x in the bottom)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>f(g(x)) = sqrt(sqrt(x^2 +3)-3) &nbsp; domain: (-infinity, -sqrt(6)) u (sqrt(6), infinity)</p>
<p>g(f(x)) = sqrt(x) &nbsp;domain: x is greater than or equal to 3 &nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: the inner function won&#39;t be defined for x less than 3, so we can&#39;t say x is greater than or equal to zero.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>3.</p>
<p>a) Temperature does not change abruptly, so we expect this relationship to be a continuous curve.</p>
<p>b) The number of boxes is an integer, so we expect this relationship to be a broken curve.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>4.</p>
<p>a) x = 9</p>
<p>b) none / impossible</p>
<p>c) for x greater than or equal to 25</p>
<p>d) y has a minimum value of 1. y grows without bound so it does not have a maximum value.</p>
