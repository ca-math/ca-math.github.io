P2: (3 points) <br>
Intersection point (-1/2, -9/4, 1/4) with work leading to your answer. <br> <br>

P2: (3 points) <br>
There are a couple of different ways to approach this, but it does involve a bit more work after stating the dot product requirement: <a, b, c> * <1, 1, 1> = 0 <br><br>
One equation of the wanted line is: <br
x = 1 + t<br>
y= -2 t <br>
z = 2+t <br>
This line is perpendicular to the given line, intersecting it at the point (1/3, 4/3, 4/3), and parallel to the given plane. (Note that you weren't expected to give this point.)

<b> Notes on the Assignment from Week 4 </b> <br>

Problem 1: 5 points <br>
a) v = <0, -5, -1> + a <1, 2, 1> with work <br>
b) no such vector v exists, with explanation <br> <br>

Problem 2: 2 points <br>
All the points P are on the plane containing points A, B, C. The reason for this is because the cross product is perpendicular to this plane, and for the vector AP to have a dot product of zero with the cross product, that implies P has to be part of the plane. <br>

Problem 3: 4 points <br>
There are several good approaches one can take here. One is to write c = -b - a, and then proceed by proving two different equalities. <br>

Problem 4: 2 points <br>
True and quick proof. Use the properties of the cross product to manipulate the left hand side. <br>

Problem 5: 2 points <br>
Hint: Write the left side as ( |u| |v| sin(theta)) ^2 and then use 1-(cos(theta))^2 = (sin(theta))^2. <br>

<b> Notes to the Assignment from week 3</b> <br>
	
Problem 1 <br>
Note that |a| b and |b| a have the same length. <br>
Set up the dot product each with vector c to show that the dot products are equal, and therefore the respective angles these two vectors form with c must be equal. <br>

Problem 2 <br>
I was hoping to see a nice drawing here. <br>
Let u = <x1, y1> the vector that connects the origin with the point. <br>
Define v = <b, -a>, the vector in the direction of the line. <br>
Take the scalar projection of u onto v. <br>
Find the distance from the tip of u to the tip of the orthogonal projection of u onto v. You can use the Pythagorean Theorem if you like. <br>
Add the distance from the previous step to the distance from the line to the origin. <br>
Be sure to take the absolute value when getting out of the square root. <br>

The evaluation is simple, 13/5.

<br> 
Problem 3 <br>
The center is the midpoint of the segment connecting the vectors and the radius is half the distance of this segment. <Br>
	
	Problem 4 <br>
	Set up the dot product and use the calculator to find the arccosine.

<b> Meeting #014 | September 11, 2020</b> <br />

<hr>

<b> Meeting #013 | September 10, 2020</b> <br />
-Hopefully SAGE worked for projections. We'll test with a couple of problems today. <br>
-We can also take time to go over any questions from this week's previous problems. <br>br>

<b> Meeting #012 | September 9, 2020</b> <br />

<b> Meeting #011 | September 8, 2020</b> <br />

<b> Meeting #010 | September 7, 2020</b> <br />
-Day 2 of 11.3<br>


<b> Week 2 Assignment Notes</b> <br />
<p>*** Please email me when you find mistakes in any answer key I share with you. Thank you. ***</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 1</p>
<p>a) With the aid of a drawing, stretch or shrink vectors a and b so that their sum, using the parallelogram rule, gives the vector c.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>b) For an algebraic argument, set up the equations:</p>
<p>a = &lt;a1, a2&gt;</p>
<p>b = &lt;b1, b2&gt;</p>
<p>c = &lt;c1, c2&gt;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Finding t and s amounts to solving the system of equations:</p>
<p>c1 = s a1 + t b1</p>
<p>c2 = s a2 + t b2</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Because the vectors are nonzero and not parallel, this system will have a unique solution.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 2</p>
<p>Parts a through c, require drawing.</p>
<p>d) Set up the equations, similar to problem 1, to find s=9/7 and t=11/7.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 3</p>
<p>After drawing neatly, write</p>
<p>c = a + AC</p>
<p>c = b - 2AC&nbsp;</p>
<p>Multiply the first equation by 2, add side by side, and then solve for c.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 4</p>
<p>Let v = &lt;a , a, a&gt;</p>
<p>Determine that sqrt(3) a = 1, so that a = sqrt(3)/3 and then list the component form.</p>
