 <br><br>

<b> Notes to the Assignment from week 3</b> <br>
	
Problem 1 <br>
Note that |a| b and |b| a have the same length. <br>
Set up the dot product each with vector c to show that the dot products are equal, and therefore the respective angles these two vectors form with c must be equal. <br>

Problem 2 <br>
I was hoping to see a nice drawing here. <br>
Let u = <x1, y1> the vector that connects the origin with the point. <br>
Define v = <b, -a>, the vector in the direction of the line. <br>
Take the scalar projection of u onto v. <br>
Find the distance from the tip of u to the tip of the orthogonal projection of u onto v. You can use the Pythagorean Theorem if you like. <br>
Add the distance from the previous step to the distance from the line to the origin. <br>
Be sure to take the absolute value when getting out of the square root. <br>

The evaluation is simple, 13/5.

<br> 
Problem 3 <br>
The center is the midpoint of the segment connecting the vectors and the radius is half the distance of this segment. <Br>
	
	Problem 4 <br>
	Set up the dot product and use the calculator to find the arccosine.

<b> Meeting #014 | September 11, 2020</b> <br />
-No new content today. We will discuss the problems from yesterday and possibly add an in-class task. <br>
-If there is time left in the class meeting, we can focus on this week's assignment, individually. <br><br>
<hr>

<b> Meeting #013 | September 10, 2020</b> <br />
-Hopefully SAGE worked for projections. We'll test with a couple of problems today. <br>
-We can also take time to go over any questions from this week's previous problems. <br>br>
<hr>

<b> Meeting #012 | September 9, 2020</b> <br />
-This is an async class. Find the practice problems in Meeting012.zip<br>
-See email I sent regarding projections with Sage. Be sure to finish the projection task with SAGE, from Meeting011. <br> <br>
<hr>
<b> Meeting #011 | September 8, 2020</b> <br />
-The general plan includes exploring more SAGE features and solve higher numbered problems from 11.3<br> <br>
<hr>

<b> Meeting #010 | September 7, 2020</b> <br />
-Day 2 of 11.3<br>


<b> Week 2 Assignment Notes</b> <br />
<p>*** Please email me when you find mistakes in any answer key I share with you. Thank you. ***</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 1</p>
<p>a) With the aid of a drawing, stretch or shrink vectors a and b so that their sum, using the parallelogram rule, gives the vector c.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>b) For an algebraic argument, set up the equations:</p>
<p>a = &lt;a1, a2&gt;</p>
<p>b = &lt;b1, b2&gt;</p>
<p>c = &lt;c1, c2&gt;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Finding t and s amounts to solving the system of equations:</p>
<p>c1 = s a1 + t b1</p>
<p>c2 = s a2 + t b2</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Because the vectors are nonzero and not parallel, this system will have a unique solution.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 2</p>
<p>Parts a through c, require drawing.</p>
<p>d) Set up the equations, similar to problem 1, to find s=9/7 and t=11/7.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 3</p>
<p>After drawing neatly, write</p>
<p>c = a + AC</p>
<p>c = b - 2AC&nbsp;</p>
<p>Multiply the first equation by 2, add side by side, and then solve for c.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 4</p>
<p>Let v = &lt;a , a, a&gt;</p>
<p>Determine that sqrt(3) a = 1, so that a = sqrt(3)/3 and then list the component form.</p>

<b> Meeting #009 | September 4, 2020</b> <br />
-We'll start class with questions on the proofs from last time. Let me know if Sage isn't working for you. <br>
-We'll likely move on to new material. There is no Meeting009.zip folder for today.<br />
-As a reminder, the assignment for this week is posted and due on Saturday @ 11:59pm. If you don't mind trying the scanning instructions for Android and iOS (Downloads), that would be great. <br> <br>

<hr>

<b> Meeting #008 | September 2, 2020</b> <br />
1) Today we'll test the Sage software and go over some basic commands.<br>
2) We may take a look at two proof questions we skipped last time. <br>
Note: We're not uploading a Meeting008.zip folder for today. <br>
