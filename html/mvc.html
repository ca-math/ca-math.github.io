The gradebook setup from the start of the year is making it difficult for the current grade to appear next to your name under progress. So, for now, please use the weekly updates to get your grade.

P1: ( 9 points) <br>
a) <br>
-finds k(x) = x / (x^2+1)^(3/2) Since the domain is x > 0, this simplified version works. <br>
-finds k'(x) = (1-2x^2) / [(x^2+1)^(5/2)] <br>
-identifies (sqrt(2)/2, ln(sqrt(2)/2)) as a candidate <br>
-justifies a global maximum by showin that k'(x) changes sign from positive to negative just this one time. <br>
-as x goes to infinity, the curvature goes to 0 (justify) <br> <Br>
b) <br>
-finds k(x) = (e^x) / (1+e^(2x))^(3/2)  <br>
-finds k'(x) = (e^x) (1-2 e^(2x)) / [(1+e^(2x))^(5/2)] <br>
-identifies (ln(sqrt(2)/2), sqrt(2)/2) as a candidate <br>
-justifies a global maximum by showin that k'(x) changes sign from positive to negative just this one time. <br>
-as x goes to infinity, the curvature goes to 0 (justify) <br> <br>
-comment: I hope you noticed the connection between parts a) and b), graphically and numerically. <br> <br>
c) <br>
-starts with y= ax^2 + bx + c and concludes that c = 0 <br>
-finds k(x) = |2a| / (1 + [2ax+b]^2)^(3/2) <br>
-gives a specific example of an equation by making a choice on b, for example (b=0, 1, 2, etc.) <Br> <br>

P2: (4 points) <br>
-for part a) sets up arclength and finds sqrt(17) + (1/4) ln(sqrt(17) + 4) with work <br>
-for part b) finds k(t) = 2 / (1+4t^2)^(3/2) <Br>
-evaluates k(0) = 2, k(1)=2/(5^1.5), k(2) = 2/(17^1.5) <br>
-for part c), concludes that as t goes from 0 to 2, the curvature gets smaller. <br> <br>

P2: ( 8 points) <br>
False, False, True, False, True, False, False, False, with reasoning <br><br>

P4: ( 5 points) <br>
-notes that r'(t) is perpendicular to both r(t) and vector c <br>
-since r'(t) is perpendicular to r(t), that means the length of r(t) is constant, which means the position vector's tip will be on a sphere. <br>
-in order for r'(t) to be perpendicular to a given vector c, it means the path must be contained on a plane whose normal vector is a multiple of c. <br>
-therefore, the path of this particle is the intersection between a sphere and a plane. <br>
-a drawing and/or detailed description was expected here. as a general suggestion, not just on this problem: let's please work on the handwriting and grammar. <br> <br>

P5: (4 points) <br>
-after using FTC, sets up arclength and finds it to be  m units. <Br>
-finds curvature equal to |pi t|. Plugging in t = m, find k(m) = m pi (drop the absolute value if we assume m > 0) <br> <br>

P6: (3 points) <br>
-sets a multiple of the velocity vector equal to the vector connecting a point on the curve to the destination <br>
-for example, m * r'(t) = < 6, 4, 9 > - r(t) <br>
-solve the system to get t= 1 and m = 2 <br>
-writes conclusion <br> <br>

P7: (2 points) <br>
A: b is the original function and a is the curvature function, with reasoning. <br>
B: a is the original function and b is the curvature function, with reasoning. <br> <br>

Overall, we did very well on this assessment, so I won't be posting general notes here. The only remark I need to share with you is: in problem 2 the unit normal vector is undefined, since the length of the unit tangent vector is zero. <br><br>

I gave full credit for your attempts on parts a) through d). It was unfair to ask you to draw after saying in class I would not ask you to. In part e) I was curious about the inequalities: <br>

Problem 1: 5 points <br>
a) v = <0, -5, -1> + a <1, 2, 1> with work <br>
b) no such vector v exists, with explanation <br> <br>

Problem 2: 2 points <br>
All the points P are on the plane containing points A, B, C. The reason for this is because the cross product is perpendicular to this plane, and for the vector AP to have a dot product of zero with the cross product, that implies P has to be part of the plane. <br>

Problem 3: 4 points <br>
There are several good approaches one can take here. One is to write c = -b - a, and then proceed by proving two different equalities. <br>

Problem 4: 2 points <br>
True and quick proof. Use the properties of the cross product to manipulate the left hand side. <br>

Problem 5: 2 points <br>
Hint: Write the left side as ( |u| |v| sin(theta)) ^2 and then use 1-(cos(theta))^2 = (sin(theta))^2. <br>

<b> Notes to the Assignment from week 3</b> <br>
	
Problem 1 <br>
Note that |a| b and |b| a have the same length. <br>
Set up the dot product each with vector c to show that the dot products are equal, and therefore the respective angles these two vectors form with c must be equal. <br>

Problem 2 <br>
I was hoping to see a nice drawing here. <br>
Let u = <x1, y1> the vector that connects the origin with the point. <br>
Define v = <b, -a>, the vector in the direction of the line. <br>
Take the scalar projection of u onto v. <br>
Find the distance from the tip of u to the tip of the orthogonal projection of u onto v. You can use the Pythagorean Theorem if you like. <br>
Add the distance from the previous step to the distance from the line to the origin. <br>
Be sure to take the absolute value when getting out of the square root. <br>

The evaluation is simple, 13/5.

<br> 
Problem 3 <br>
The center is the midpoint of the segment connecting the vectors and the radius is half the distance of this segment. <Br>
	
	Problem 4 <br>
	Set up the dot product and use the calculator to find the arccosine.

<b> Meeting #014 | September 11, 2020</b> <br />
-No new content today. We will discuss the problems from yesterday and possibly add an in-class task. <br>
-If there is time left in the class meeting, we can focus on this week's assignment, individually. <br><br>
<hr>

<b> Meeting #013 | September 10, 2020</b> <br />
-Hopefully SAGE worked for projections. We'll test with a couple of problems today. <br>
-We can also take time to go over any questions from this week's previous problems. <br>br>
<hr>

<b> Meeting #012 | September 9, 2020</b> <br />
-This is an async class. Find the practice problems in Meeting012.zip<br>
-See email I sent regarding projections with Sage. Be sure to finish the projection task with SAGE, from Meeting011. <br> <br>
<hr>
<b> Meeting #011 | September 8, 2020</b> <br />
-The general plan includes exploring more SAGE features and solve higher numbered problems from 11.3<br> <br>

<b> Meeting #010 | September 7, 2020</b> <br />
-Day 2 of 11.3<br>


<b> Week 2 Assignment Notes</b> <br />
<p>*** Please email me when you find mistakes in any answer key I share with you. Thank you. ***</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 1</p>
<p>a) With the aid of a drawing, stretch or shrink vectors a and b so that their sum, using the parallelogram rule, gives the vector c.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>b) For an algebraic argument, set up the equations:</p>
<p>a = &lt;a1, a2&gt;</p>
<p>b = &lt;b1, b2&gt;</p>
<p>c = &lt;c1, c2&gt;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Finding t and s amounts to solving the system of equations:</p>
<p>c1 = s a1 + t b1</p>
<p>c2 = s a2 + t b2</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Because the vectors are nonzero and not parallel, this system will have a unique solution.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 2</p>
<p>Parts a through c, require drawing.</p>
<p>d) Set up the equations, similar to problem 1, to find s=9/7 and t=11/7.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 3</p>
<p>After drawing neatly, write</p>
<p>c = a + AC</p>
<p>c = b - 2AC&nbsp;</p>
<p>Multiply the first equation by 2, add side by side, and then solve for c.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 4</p>
<p>Let v = &lt;a , a, a&gt;</p>
<p>Determine that sqrt(3) a = 1, so that a = sqrt(3)/3 and then list the component form.</p>

<b> Meeting #009 | September 4, 2020</b> <br />
-We'll start class with questions on the proofs from last time. Let me know if Sage isn't working for you. <br>
-We'll likely move on to new material. There is no Meeting009.zip folder for today.<br />
-As a reminder, the assignment for this week is posted and due on Saturday @ 11:59pm. If you don't mind trying the scanning instructions for Android and iOS (Downloads), that would be great. <br> <br>

<hr>

<b> Meeting #008 | September 2, 2020</b> <br />
1) Today we'll test the Sage software and go over some basic commands.<br>
2) We may take a look at two proof questions we skipped last time. <br>
Note: We're not uploading a Meeting008.zip folder for today. <br>
