<b> Meeting #009 | September 4, 2020</b> <br />
-We'll start class with questions on the proofs from last time. Let me know if Sage isn't working for you. <br>
-We'll likely move on to new material. There is no Meeting009.zip folder for today.<br />
-As a reminder, the assignment for this week is posted and due on Saturday @ 11:59pm. If you don't mind trying the scanning instructions for Android and iOS (Downloads), that would be great. <br> <br>

<b> Meeting #008 | September 2, 2020</b> <br />
1) Today we'll test the Sage software and go over some basic commands.<br>
2) We may take a look at two proof questions we skipped last time. <br>
Note: We're not uploading a Meeting008.zip folder for today. <br>

<p>Notes/Key</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>1.</p>
<p>a) All points on or inside the cylinder with radius 3 stretched in the y-direction.</p>
<p>b) all points outside the sphere with radius 1 centered at (0, 0, 1)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>Two inequalities:</p>
<p>z greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 8.</p>
<p>x^2 + y^2 is less than or equal to 4.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>3.</p>
<p>All points (x,y,z) that satisfy: 14x -6y -10z = 9.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>4.</p>
<p>This was a bit messy but the algebra does come through in the end.</p>
