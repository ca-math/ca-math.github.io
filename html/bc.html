<b> Week 2 Assignment Notes</b> <br />
<p>*** Feel free to use the notes/key below to go over your work. Please email me when you find mistakes in any answer key I share with you. Thank you. ***</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 1</p>
<p>a) A horizontal shrink by a factor of 1/2 and a reflection over the x-axis occurs here. Your sketch, without a calculator should include at least one period.</p>
<p>b) The piecewise function consists of two pieces that connect at the origin. To the right of the origin the exponential function y = e^x has been shifted downward by 1 unit.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 2</p>
<p>If we measure in cents, the daily payout option is 2^30 - 1 cents.</p>
<p>The monthly payout option of 1 million dollars is 10^8 cents.</p>
<p>To compare the two quantities, note that 2^10 = 1024 &gt; 1000 = 10^3</p>
<p>It follows that (2^10)^3 = 2^30 is greater than (10^9).</p>
<p>The daily payout is preferred if the goal is to earn more.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 3</p>
<p>a) Yes, but justify with short proof. Examples are not proofs.</p>
<p>b) h is not necessarily odd (give an example)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;If f is odd, f(g(x)) will be odd (justify).</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;If f is even, f(g(x)) will be even (justify).</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 4</p>
<p>f(x) = -3x (x+1) (x-2) or f(x)=-3x^3+3x^2+6x</p>
<p>with work</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 5</p>
<p>a) f+g will be even (justify with short proof)</p>
<p>b) f+g will be odd (justify with short proof)</p>
<p>c) Neither / not necessarily (give an example)</p>

<b> Meeting #009 | September 4, 2020</b> <br />
-Expect more review/practice today. Materials (Meeting009.zip) are now live. <br />
-In the practice.pdf file, CA stands for 'Calculator Active', which means the graphing calculator can be used. <br>
-The assignment for Friday had the attach/submit option accidentally enabled. That was a mistake on my part. No work is due this Friday. <br>
-In the Downloads section I have added two resources: a Precalculus textbook (use it to review) and scanning instructions for Android and iOS. <br>
