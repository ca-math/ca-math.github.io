<i> If you find mistakes below, please email me. I will fix any misspellings soon.</i>  <br>
<i> Individual scores for this assignment will either be included in the weekly report or emailed to you. </i> <br>
-General note 1: get in the habit of using implicit differentiating;  the recent topic is a good opportunity to apply what we learned.<br>
-General Note 2: please remember to simplify or present final answers in three decimal places. <br>
-General Note 3: please follow instructions on the assessment cover page. <br>  <br>

P1: (5 points) <br>
-neat drawing with assigned variables for the lengths: x, y, z, for example <br>
-uses the law of cosines: z^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 2 x y cos(2pi/3) <br>
-uses z = sqrt(28), differentiates implicitly with respect to time and finds dz/dt = -600 sqrt(7) miles per hour with work shown <br>
-writes a FULL sentence: At the instant when the aircraft is 2 miles from the impact point P and the missile is 4 miles from P, the distance between the aircraft and the missile is changing at a rate of -600 sqrt(7) miles per hour.<br> <br>

P2: (6 points)<br>
a)<br>
-neat drawing with the variables assigned to lengths <br>
-sets up ratio, for example, x/6 = 30 / y<br>
-finds dy/dt = 27/5 or 5.400 ft/s<br>
-writes a FULL sentence: When the student is 10 feet away from the light source, the length of the student's shadow is changing at a rate of 27/5 ft/s.<br><br>

b)<br>
-Answers 'no' with clarification: The tip of the shadow and the length of the shadow are moving at the same rate. This is different from the case where the light shines from a lamppost, in which case the "tip" changes at a rate given by the sum of the two rates. <br><br>

P3: (1 point) <br>
-Use the chain rule: dy/dx = dy/dt * dt/dx = (-2 y^3 - 3 y t^2) / (cos t (6 t y^2  + t^3)) <br> <br>

-tangent line equation: y - 0.4 = (-3/100) (x-4) or simplified version<br>
-normal line equation: y - 0.4 = (100/3) (x-4) or simplified version <br><br>

b)<br>
-finds dy/dx <br>
-evaluates slope as -1/2  <br>
-tangent line equation: y - 2 = (-1/2) (x-1) or simplified version<br>
-normal line equation: y - 2 = 2 (x-1) or simplified version <br><br>


P2: (5 points) <br>
-shows the function to be differentiable at x=0 (please use one-sided derivative notation or limits)<br>
-shows that g'(2) does not exist (please use one-sided derivative notation or limits) <br>
-gives formula for g'(x) as a piecewise function with three cases:<br>
 g'(x) 2 if x < or = 0 <br>
 g'(x)= 2-2x if 0 < x < 2 <br>
 g'(x)= -1 if x > 2 <br><br>
 (Note: the equal option at x=0 in the piecewise definition could be on either branch but not on both ) <br>
-sketch both functions; be sure to clearly have open circles on the derivative function when x=2. <br><br>


P3: (4 points) <br>
-shows that f'(3) and f'(3) do not exist, either using the limit definition or one-sided derivatives. Please do not solve this without first writing the original function as a piecewise function WITHOUT absolute value signs. <br>
-gives a piecewise formula for f'(x):<br>
f'(x) = 2x if x < -3 <br>
f'(x)= -2x if -3 < x < 3 <br>
f'(x) = 2x if x > 3 <br>
-gives a neat sketch of f and f'. Be sure to, once again, clearly indicate open circles at when x = -3 and x=3 on the graph of f'(x). <br> <br>


P4: (4 points) <br>
-finds f'(x), sets equal to zero, and solves for x. <br>
-part a)  x= 2pi/3 + 2 k pi   or x = 4pi/3 + 2 k pi <br>
-part b)  x= 7pi/6 +2 k pi or x = 11pi/6 + 2 k pi <br><br>

-sets dF/dtheta = 0 and solves for theta = arctan(mu)<br><br>

P6: (4 points) <br>
-shows that h'(-2) and h'(1) do not exist. Writing h(x) as a piecewise function with NO absolute value signs is a good way to approach this problem. Use the one sided derivatives or limit definition to confirm that h'(-2) and h'(1) do not exist. (Saying that it's a corner just isn't enough.) <br>
-states h'(x) in a piecewise fashion: <br>
h'(x) = -2 if x < -2 <br>
h'(x) = 0 if -2 < x < 1 <br>
h'(x) = 2 if x>1 <br>

-neatly sketches both functions, with clear open circles at (-2, 0), (-2, -2), (1,0), and (1, 2). <br> <br>

<u>Assessment Notes (Maximum: 12 points)</u> <br>
<u> Group reminders: </u>
I took off at least 10% for any of these: did not include start and end time; did not include honor code; submitted work late. <br>
Please note that more points will be taken off if this continues. Most of you have been very good about following instructions so far! <br> <br>

P1 (3 points) <br>
- Finds dy/dx = 1 + (sec(x))^2 <br>
- Evaluates dy/dx at x=pi to get slope equals 2. <br>
- Finds the equation of the tangent line: y = 2x - pi <br><br>

P2 (4 points) <br>
-draws a careful picture with details<br>
-finds an equation relating theta and x:  x = 10 sin(theta)<br>
-finds dx/dtheta = 10 cos(theta)<br>
-evaluates dx/dtheta = 5 ft/rad (with correct units) <br><br>

P3 (4 points) <br>
Let (a, a/(a+1)) be the point(s) where such tangent line meets the curve. <br>
-finds f'(a) = 1/(a+1)^2<br>
-sets f'(a) from first step equal to the rise over run for the segment connecting (1, 2) to (a, a/(a+1))<br>
-solves for a and finds two solutions: a= -2-sqrt(3) and a=-2+sqrt(3)<br>
-finds the corresponding y-values to give the both coordinates of the points (-2-sqrt(3), (1+sqrt(3))/2) and (-2+sqrt(3), (1-sqrt(3))/2)<br>
Note 1: Please rationalize denominators. I did not take off points this time, but keep in mind for the future. <br>
Note 2: When setting up an equation of tangent line, please don't write y - y1 = f'(x) (x-x1) The slope part (f'(x)) needs to be EVALUATED, so you can write it as f'(x1). If you write f'(x), the equation is a curve and not a line.  <br><br>

P4 (1 point)<br>
R'(0) = 1 with quotient rule without simplifying. In other words plug in x=0 immediately after the first step of the quotient rule. If you tried to simplify, ... (finish this sentence yourself). <br><br>

<b> Assignment Notes - Week 6 (25 points maximum)</b> <br />
 <i> If there are typos or mistakes below, please email me. Thank you! </i> <br><br>
P1: (4 points) <br><br>
a) <br>
f'(x)= 6x + 2 with work that uses the definition. <br>
f''(x) = 6 with work that uses the definition. <br>
b) <br>
f'(x)=3x^2-3 with work that uses the definition.<br>
f''(x)=6x with work that uses the definition.<br>
<br><br>

P2: (2 points) <br><br>
a=f(x)  b=f'(x)  and c=f''(x)<br>
Please chop the domain into subintervals and comment, in grammatically correct sentences, how the y-values of graph b, for example, correctly measure the slope of the tangent line on graph a. Comment on signs (positive,negative, zero) and magnitude. Do the same for the relationship between graphs b and c. Very important: some of you have previewed or taken calculus before. Do not (!) solve problems using content/concepts that we have not discussed in class this academic year. You will not earn any credit for attempts that involve other calculus methods and concepts. <br><br>

P3: (5 points) <br><br>
a)<br>
Neatly presented graph with labels. Be sure to start at the origin (0,0) and highlight the different steepness for the segments where the person runs faster (slope getting steeper, similar to the graph of y=x^2 in Q1)), walk (not too steep -- a segment is fine), at rest (horizontal segment), run (steeper than the walking segment), and the final segment is identical similar to the one on the time interval [3, 8]. <br>

b) <br>
Be sure to have open endpoints here, since the position graph will not be differentiable at the transition points. The slope for the segment when the person is walking is zero, so the graph should be on the x-axis with open circles at each endpoint. The commentary and explanation was appreciated and rewarded here.<br><br>

P4: (6 points) <br><br>
a)<br><br>
f'(x) = -1/(2sqrt(9-x)) using the definition(!)<br>
dom of f: (-infinity, 9]<br>
dom of f': (-infinity, 9)<br><br>
a)<br><br>
f'(x) = (2x^2-6x+2)/(2x-3)^2 using the definition(!)<br>
dom of f: (-infinity, 3/2) u (3/2, infinity)<br>
dom of f': (-infinity, 3/2) u (3/2, infinity)<br><br>


P5: (8 points) <br><br>

a) <br> 
The left sided derivative is -1. Show this with limits. <br>
The right sided derivative is 1. Show this with limits.<br>
b)<br>
Graph with labels. <br>
c)<br>
jump discontinuity @ x=0 (with explanation)<br>
infinite discontinuity @ x=5 (with explanation)<br>
d) <br>
The function is not differentiable @ x=0, x=4, and x=5. At x=0 and x=5 f(x) is not differentiable because f(x) is not continuous there. At x=4 the function is not differentiable because the one-sided derivatives are not equal to each other. <br><br>


 <br> <br>


<b> Assessment Notes - Week 6 (15 points maximum)</b> <br />
General notes: <br>
-Please read and follow instructions on cover page. Not including the start and end time for example, led to points being taken off. <br>
-Pay attention to units. <br>
-Be sure to follow the 3 decimal places rule or leave final answers as reduced fractions. <br> <br>

P1: (5 points) <br> <br>
a)<br>
   0.040 with quotient <br>
   0.220 with quotient <br>
   0.880 with quotient <br>
b)<br>
(f(2)-f(0))/(2-0) is the best estimate because the secant line has a slope that appears to be closest to the slope of the tangent line at x=1. <br>
(f(3)-f(1))/(3-1) is the worst estimate because the secant line has a slope that appears to be signficantly flatter when compared to the slope of the tangent line at x=1. <br>
Other notes: Be sure to use three decimal places. <br>


 
P2: (5 points)<br><br>
a)<br>
-uses definition <br>
-uses conjugate <br>
-answer <br>
f'(x) = -5/(2 sqrt(3-5x)) <br>
b)<br>
dom of f: (-infinity, 3/5] with reasoning <br>
dom of f': (-infiniy, 3/5) with reasoning <br>

P3: 5 points <br><br>

a) F'(1950) is approximately equal to 0.100 average children per woman per year<br>
b) F'(1965) is approximately equal to -0.110 average children per woman per year<br>
c) F'(1987) is approximately equal to 0.050 average children per woman per year<br>
Please note: three decimal places and units as well. <br>
b)
Meaning: At each instance above, for every additional year, F(t) changes by approximately the value of the derivative (measured in average number of children per woman per year). A negative value for the derivative, like in 1965, means that the rate went down by approximately 0.110 average children per woman from 1965 to 1966. <br>

c) Multiple comments were accepted here. Some the comments from the group were a bit too creative (and inaccurate) but I did not take off points. You are not expected to know US history and it's okay if you simply referred to the labels on the graph. <br><br>

<b> Notes on Assignment and Assessment from Week 5</b> <br />

<u>Assignment Notes (Each problem is worth 5 points) </u> <br>
 <b>Quick Group reminders</b>
 Please learn to scan into a pdf. A reminder was placed on myCushing.<br>
 Do not use a calculator when it is not allowed.<br>
 Do not justify work with concepts or techniques we have not learned/taught in this  class this year. <br><br>
 
P1: a) The first limit does not exist. Confirm by showing the one sided limits to be infinity and 0. <br>
    a) The second limit does not exist. One approach is to write u = 1/x and note that as x goes to 0 from the the positive side, u goes to infinity, and as x goes to 0 from the left, u goes to negative infinity. You can then argue by using the graph of f(u) = int(u) / u.<br>
	b) The limit exists for all real numbers (this sentence was edited on Oct 1). The function has removable discontinuities at all integers. Be sure to include a sketch here or show work in as much detail as possible. <br><br>
	
P2: a) 4, 0, 1<br>
b) 1, 0, DNE, DNE  (I gave credit if you wrote -infinity and infinity for the last two answers, as long as you explained your reasoning.) <br>
c) Continuous on intervals of the form (1/(n+1), 1/n) on (-1, 1), and also continuous for all c such that |c| < 1. Be sure to explain.<br>
 
P3: a) True with careful use of IVT on the given interval. Set up a single function that represent the difference between the position functions for each day. Be sure to comment on continuity.<br>
 b) Use the IVT on f(x) = x^3 + 1 - x on an appropriate interval. Be sure to point out why the function is continuous. <br>
<br>
P4: a) 0  b) infinity  c) infinity  d) -infinity  (show work for all parts)
    e) Sketch graph agreeing with the answers in the previous parts.
	<br><br>
P5: a) -3/4 (use conjugate)  b) (a-b)/2    c) infinity    d) infinity   e) -infinity.
 

 
 <br> <br>

<u>Assessment Notes (5 points for each problem)</u> <br>
P1: a) pi/2 with steps/explanation (start with e^x as x goes to infinity) <br>
P1: b) -1/2 with steps/explanation (divide both numerator and denominator by the nonzero quantity e^x; use limit notation with care) <br>
P1: c) 0 with steps/explanation (we can use the Squeeze Theorem here, as long as you explain carefully, or after rewriting argue that cos(x) oscillates on [-1,1] and is being divided by e^(2x), which goes to positive infinity, hence...) <br>

P2: Please do not just give a formula without explaining your reasoning. <br>
Multiple answers work here. One possibility is y = -(x-2) / ((x^2)(x-3)). Confirm each of the conditions algebraically.<br>

P3: Rewrite as f(x) = ln x - x - sqrt(x); Confirm that f(x) is continuous (with reasoninig) on the given interval; apply and refer to the Intermediate Value Theorem to conclude that the statement is True. <br><br>

<p>Problem 1: 6 points maximum</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>3 points for each part.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Most of us did well on this problem. Make sure you use open circles vs solid circles to indicate clearly whether or not a point is part of the graph. Additionally, be sure to label the axes and indicate your scale (units) and key points.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 2: 4 points maximum</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Each limit, with units included, is 1 point.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Before the injection at t=12 the amount of drug in the bloodstream drops to 150mg (reaching it); immediately after the injection a spike in the total amount of drug in the bloodstream occurs, so the amount rises to just below 300mg, without reaching 300mg. (2 points)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 3: 5 points maximum</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>3 points for part a)</p>
<p>We can use the conjugate here or the exponential form. For example, if we are comparing f(x) with f(-x), &nbsp;let&nbsp;</p>
<p>e^u = x + sqrt(x^2+1)</p>
<p>e^v = (-x)+sqrt(x^2+1)</p>
<p>Multiply side by side, and then proceed to show that u and v, the original y values for the given function, turn out to be opposites of each other.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>No matter your approach, explanations are expected, especially for crucial steps.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>2 points for b)</p>

<b> Week 2 Assignment Notes</b> <br />
<p>*** Feel free to use the notes/key below to go over your work. Please email me when you find mistakes in any answer key I share with you. Thank you. ***</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 1</p>
<p>a) A horizontal shrink by a factor of 1/2 and a reflection over the x-axis occurs here. Your sketch, without a calculator should include at least one period.</p>
<p>b) The piecewise function consists of two pieces that connect at the origin. To the right of the origin the exponential function y = e^x has been shifted downward by 1 unit.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 2</p>
<p>If we measure in cents, the daily payout option is 2^30 - 1 cents.</p>
<p>The monthly payout option of 1 million dollars is 10^8 cents.</p>
<p>To compare the two quantities, note that 2^10 = 1024 &gt; 1000 = 10^3</p>
<p>It follows that (2^10)^3 = 2^30 is greater than (10^9).</p>
<p>The daily payout is preferred if the goal is to earn more.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 3</p>
<p>a) Yes, but justify with short proof. Examples are not proofs.</p>
<p>b) h is not necessarily odd (give an example)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;If f is odd, f(g(x)) will be odd (justify).</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;If f is even, f(g(x)) will be even (justify).</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 4</p>
<p>f(x) = -3x (x+1) (x-2) or f(x)=-3x^3+3x^2+6x</p>
<p>with work</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Problem 5</p>
<p>a) f+g will be even (justify with short proof)</p>
<p>b) f+g will be odd (justify with short proof)</p>
<p>c) Neither / not necessarily (give an example)</p>
