 <font color="red"> <b> A note regarding myCushing grades:</b> The fall semester ends in February. The gradebook setup from the start of the year is making it difficult for the current grade to appear next to your name under progress. So, for now, please use the weekly updates to get your grade. (The 'fall_grade' label was placed there to help inform you. There are few other classes that do not have this.) Let me know if you have any questions.   </font> <br>
